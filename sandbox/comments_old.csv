2,2,"The United States has suffered one of the worst wildfire seasons in recent history this year. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, as of now, more than 8.5 million acres have burned in 2017 so farmore than 47% higher than the 10 year average. In 2016, the Department of the Interior and the USFS spent almost $2 billion combined on wildfire suppression. Interjurisdictional coordination challenges and an accumulation of hazardous fuels in national forests due to a lack of active forest management increase fire risk to communities and threaten the federal government's ability to rein in firefighting costs. We must address the chronic litigation that hinders our resource/land management professionals
 Federal Firefighting Costs (Suppression Only) per year 2016 total fires 67,743 with 5,509,995 acreage burned cost was $1,975,545,000,.... 2015 we had 68,151 fires on 10,125,149 burned acres and costs $2,130,543,000, 2014 total fired 63,312 on 3,595,613 Acres burned at costs $1,522,149,000, .... 2013 fires 47,579 on 4,319,546 acres burned with cost of $1,740,934,000,..... 2012 fires 67,774 on 9,326,238 acres burned at cost of $1,902,446,000, In 2011 fires 74,126 with 8,711,367 acres burned at cost of $1,374,525,000. This is outrageous, new management new ideas are need.
Time to Sell Timber for Forest Service income which also thins the forest of old growth and dead bushes. USFS should expedite regulatory analyses for timber sales. This will provide the USFS with some of the revenue it needs to execute critical and time-sensitive pre-fire thinning and cutting work. improving forest health and reducing wildfire risk. Increased active management will generate more revenue for the federal treasury and the critical services provided by counties, and promote job creation and economic growth in counties across the nation. a market-driven approach to forest management projects can work to achieve both forest management goals and increased forest production. Increased utilization of commercial thinning activities reduces fire risk, provides ecological benefits, and can provide the federal government with additional financial resources to better manage our forests. USFS with an opportunity to implement improved and efficient forest management practices and minimize the impacts of catastrophic fire. The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) must be reformed to ensure litigants are not able to exploit the law, and avoid legal caps on attorney's fees against the USFS.
So why can the past EPA administration criticize gas and oil industry, coal, pipelines, greenhouse gas emissions when the clear and present danger was right in front of them in the form of Wildfires. Wildfires contain particulate matter, hydrocarbons and other organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides, and trace minerals. The individual compounds present in smoke number in the thousands. Particulate matter is the principal pollutant of concern from wildfire smoke. these particles are within the fine particle PM2.5 fraction and can be inhaled into the deepest recesses of the lung and may represent a greater health concern than larger particles. Another pollutant of concern during smoke events is carbon monoxide, which is a colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of wood or other organic materials. Wildfire gaseous pollutants are precursors for ozone (O3) production. 
Wildfire was not even in the reports as to cause of greenhouse gas emissions. Total witch hurt. Agencies need to re examine all emission reports. California should be part of Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). Repeal and replace or review the Wildland Fire Leadership Council (WFLC), National Strategy Committee (NSC) , Fire Executive Council (FEC) , National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, Federal Land Assistance, Wildland Fire Implementation Plan (WFIP), Wildland Fire Situation Analysis, The Wildland Fire Situation Analysis process, Guidance for Implementation of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy (2009), Land/Resource Management Plan (L/RMP), Management and Enhancement Act of 2009 (FLAME Act), WFLC was established in April 2002 by the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to provide an intergovernmental committee to support the implementation and coordination of Federal Fire Management Policy.

August 11, 2016 EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) is pleased to transmit its response to a request from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) to review and provide advice on scientific charge questions associated with the EPA's draft Assessment of the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas on Drinking Water Resources (External Review Draft, EPA/600/R-15/047, June 2015). ...NOTED..... EPA Executive Summary are ambiguous and appear inconsistent with the observations, data, and levels of uncertainty presented and discussed in the body of the draft Assessment Report. 
EPA Science Advisory Board August 11, 2016, said ""We did NOT find evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States."" The BLM oversees approximately 700 million subsurface acres of Federal mineral estate and carries out some of the regulatory duties of the Secretary of the Interior for an additional 56 million acres of Indian mineral estate across the United States. Currently, nearly 36 million acres of Federal land are under lease for potential oil and gas development in 33 states. As of June 30, 2014, there were approximately 47,000 active oil and gas leases on public lands, and approximately 95,000 oil and gas wells.
Science Advisory Board in 2016 found that the past EPA did not support quantitatively its conclusion about lack of evidence for widespread, systemic impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, and did not clearly describe the system(s) of interest (e.g., groundwater, surface water), the scale of impacts (i.e., local or regional), nor the definitions of ""systemic"" and ""widespread."" . The SAB concludes that if the EPA retains this conclusion, the EPA should provide quantitative analysis that supports its conclusion that hydraulic fracturing has not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources. Twenty-six of the 30 members of the SAB Panel concluded that the statement also requires clarification and additional explanation (e.g., discuss what is meant by ""any observed change"" in the definition of ""impact"" in Appendix J, and consider including modifying adjectives before the words ""widespread, systemic impact"" in the statement on page ES-6).",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0234,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jump</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span><i></i>"

5,5,"Federal regulation agencies must again balance its statutory requirements to issue regulations and its commitment to providing regulatory certainty through improvements to existing regulations that were flawed, outdated, ineffective, or unnecessarily burdensome, two deregulatory actions for each final regulatory action, without more new costs on the U.S. economy. Lower regulatory burdens on the American people though commonsense regulatory reform, curbing unnecessary regulatory burdens that stifle economic growth for communities across the country. Regulations that are outdated, duplicative, or unnecessary, yet they continue to impose costly burdens need rescinded, eliminated or modify them . President Trump has committed to reducing the regulatory burden on the American public in order to promote economic growth, job creation, and innovation so the agencies should follow his lead for all taxpayers. Excessive and unnecessary federal regulations limit individual freedom and suppress the innovation and entrepreneurship that make America great. To ensure that regulations are consistent with law, necessary to correct a substantial market failure, and net beneficial to the public. The peoples regulatory philosophy and approach emphasize the connection between limited government intervention and individual liberty , more limited, effective, and accountable regulatory policy.. Regulatory policy should serve the American people by staying within legal limits and administering the law with respect for due process and fair notice. It is essential to manage the costs associated with the governmental imposition of private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations. Promote sound science and economic analysis that akes seriously retrospective review and the imperative to evaluate the actual costs and benefits of existing regulations. Agencies should develop improved regulatory impact analyses of the costs and benefits of their actions, relying on reasonable assumptions and public input. Review previous regulatory impact assessments to ensure that they reflect the best possible estimate of costs and benefits to the taxpayers. Philosophy to emphasizes the rule of law, including constitutional, statutory, and procedural limits on administrative action. For instance, OIRA requires agencies to indicate the legal authority for regulatory actions, whether from a statute or judicial order.Look closely at planned regulatory and deregulatory actions to ensure that they follow the law and the correct administrative procedures. Agencies should closely examine their use of sub-regulatory actions, such as guidance documents, enforcement manuals, interpretive rules can serve an important role in explaining existing statutory or regulatory requirements; however, they should not be used to impose new or additional legal obligations or requirements. Take a close look at existing guidance documents to assess whether some of them should be withdrawn or modified, or whether their requirements should go through a process of notice and comment rulemaking. Clarifying existing law rather than making new law will provide greater transparency about the regulatory process and ensure that regulated entities and the public have notice and an opportunity to comment on significant changes in regulatory requirements. Agencies should administer the law found in statutes, not make new law, and they should respect the judicial role in enforcing limits on administrative power. Moreover, faithful execution of the laws requires the Administration be directly accountable for its regulatory policies and ensure that regulations and their enforcement benefit the American people. A new direction that recognizes the costs of accumulated regulatory burdens and looks for ways to reduce those burdens by modifying or eliminating regulations; revising or eliminating guidance documents; and streamlining information collections. Should be guided by good regulatory practices, which include regulating only when necessary, carefully studying lawful alternatives, and engaging with the public and affected parties. Agencies should regulate only when the benefits substantially outweigh the costs, and OIRA should carefully examine each proposed regulation to ensure that it is the least burdensome regulatory approach that meets the relevant statutory standards. Push against the inertia of steadily expanding regulatory burdens and represent this Administration's commitment to reducing regulations that no longer benefit our society. Provide a clear message that the public can invest and plan for the future without the looming threat of burdensome and unnecessary new regulations.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0249,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">quick</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> over the <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span><i></i>"

Congress mandated the collection of monies by the Government be controlled by the Miscellaneous Receipts Act use it and enact New rule to Change the independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to be accountable to the people, which created by Dodd-Frank (repeal), the concern goes well beyond lack of regulatory review : there exists a fundamental lack of accountability, either executive or legislative or judicial, since the President cannot remove the director, and since Congress does not fund the self-financing agency.

Each year the wind industry is responsible for killing some 440,000 birds, including golden and bald eagles. According to estimates by the American Bird Conservancy, Even though many of these birds are protected by laws such as the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act, in a congress 2015 report, Bureaucrats in Obama Administration routinely applied laws differently, often giving a pass to their allies while vigorously prosecuting businesses and individuals who do not share their far-left political ideals. A prime example of this can be found in the clearly differential treatment towards the protection of animals. In those years renewable energy companies had enjoyed preferential treatment, including the ability to avoid compliance with laws as well as generous tax breaks, government loans, and subsidies unavailable to oil and gas companies, despite the inherent risk and financial loss repeatedly presented. 
A congress report outlined, while administration agencies In September 2014, were actively blocking oil and natural gas development claiming to be protecting endangered species, it developed a plan intended to ""create a framework to streamline renewable energy permitting...on more than 22 million acres"" of public and private land in the California desert full of endangered animals. The 8,000 page plan, which encompassed nearly one-quarter of the state, had been in the works for five years under President Obama to avoid ""typically long, complicated environmental reviews,"" which are in place because of these environmentalists themselves. There serves perhaps no greater example of preferential treatment Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System project near the California and Nevada border. In addition to the clear cronyism displayed on this project, the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System project serves as a textbook example of how far this Administration is willing to bend over backwards for its friends at the expense of others. Owners were granted federal money to build the Ivanpah project in an area that ""served as prime desert tortoise habitat,"" which resulted in tortoise casualties. The tortoises, which are federally listed as threatened, are not the only casualties of Ivanpah as project biologists reported the killing of 76 birds in the final three months of last year alone. In addition, the Ivanpah project had been labeled a risk to air safety due to an unsafe glare coming from the thousands of billboard-sized mirrors ""nearly blinding"" pilots. As if killing animals, endangering the lives of aircraft passengers, and perpetuating the revolving door of cronyism with this project was not enough, Ivanpah owners successfully got the agency to delay the repayment of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal loans only to astonishingly apply for a $539 million grant from the U.S. Treasury to pay off their debt to agency. These are just fraction of efforts by past Administration to play favorites, picking their far-left environmentalist friends as winners while attacking hydraulic fracturing and subsequently the oil and gas industries all at the expense of the American people.
Wind turbines are over two times as tall as the skyboxes at a Stadium and taller than the Statue of Liberty. And the blades on windmills can be as long as a football field and their blinking lights can be seen for twenty miles.
Solar panels pose major risks to firefighters who are struggling to finds ways to safely put out blazes caused by the alternative energy source. For example, in 2013 it took more than 300 firefighters over 72 hours to put out an 11-alarm fire at a massive distribution center in South New Jersey, which ultimately destroyed the entire building. The roof of the almost 300,000 square foot facility was lined with more than 7,000 solar panels. One of the major concerns for firefighters is the risk of electrocution from solar panels because most cannot be turned off, leaving the wiring hot and dangerous. These dangers have forced firefighters to extinguish fires from a distance and focus merely on containing solar panel fires rather than trying to save the actual building.
Solar panels and wind turbines cannot be made without fossil fuels. A wind turbine is comprised of primarily steel (89.1%) and fiberglass (5.8%). Steel is made from iron ore through a process using coal or natural gas, and fiberglass is made from petroleum-based chemicals. In fact, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) listed as a disadvantage of wind power, ""The consumption of fossil fuels and water during construction and decommissioning can be significant."" 
Solar panels rely on photovoltaic cells to capture sunlight that are composed of rare metals. These metals are acquired through mining, and at least one of the primary metals is made ""from ash derived from burning coal for the production of energy.""

8,8,"researchers have found that the climate around a large WIND farm in Texas was affected by the presence of the turbines. found a ""significant warming trend"" , This could have long term effects on WILDLIFE living in the immediate areas of larger wind farms.

 It could also affect regional weather patterns as warmer areas affect the formation of cloud and even wind speeds Satellite data over a large area in Texas, that is now covered by four of the world's largest wind farms, found that over a decade the local temperature went up by almost 1C as more turbines are built.. Taking the ground temperatures measured by satellites, they detected a warming of 0.5C at night in the region directly under the farm. This approach was first attempted by David Keith and colleagues in 2004. When they compared the climate in their model with and without extremely large wind farms (large enough to generate about twice the world's total present electrical demand), they found that in addition to climate effects in the immediate vicinity of the wind farms, there were changes in climate all around the world. Vautard's study agrees with this earlier work, in finding that the climate impacts of wind farms extend beyond the farms themselves and are caused by changes in the flow of the atmosphere that bring warming and cooling to different regions around the wind farms.

I think we should be careful with these things.

9,9,"September 2006 News article claimed that polar bears in the Arctic are threatened with extinction by global warming. The article quoted a visitor to the Arctic who claims he saw two distressed polar bears. According to the article, the man noted that ""one of the polar bears looked to be dead and the other one looked to be exhausted."" The article did not state the bears were actually dead or exhausted, rather that they ""looked"" that way. What was missing from this article was the fact that according to biologists who study the animals, polar bears are doing quite well. Biologist Dr. Mitchell Taylor from the Arctic government of Nunavut, a territory of Canada, refuted these claims in May when he noted that ""Of the 13 populations of polar bears in Canada, 11 are stable or increasing in number. They are not going extinct, or even appear to be affected at present."" Sadly, it appears that reporting anecdotes and hearsay as fact, has now replaced the basic tenets of journalism.

However, the analysis in Magazine excluded nearly 11,000 studies or more than 90 percent of the papers dealing with global warming, according to a critique by social scientist.

10,10,"General Comment: Natural resource managers for DoD are faced with significant and recurring challenges associated with ensuring sustainability and compatibility of both Military Mission and threatened, endangered, and at-risk species requirements. Final approval of this Draft Compensatory Mitigation Policy should provide tangible opportunities to generate much needed flexibility in facilitating those requirements. The fact that USFWS leadership, with a knowledge and understanding of the many complex issues at hand, had the foresight to develop this reasonable and defensible alternative solution to traditional processes is encouraging. There will no doubt be challenges associated with developing and implementing specific compensatory mitigation plans; however, it is abundantly clear to me that this new policy can further encourage effective collaboration, enable proactive resolution of complex issues, and ultimately benefit both natural resources and Military Mission requirements. Additionally, having the opportunity to shift from a primarily reactive approach to more proactive one should pay big dividends with respect to implementation of adaptive ecosystem management strategies on a landscape scale. In the increasingly complicated and ever evolving landscape of policy, resource limitations, and competing requirements, this new Policy is a refreshing approach. Mitigation and resolution of complex issues to the benefit of natural resources while also ensuring flexibility for execution of necessary actions in a reasonable, defensible, and cost effective manner simply makes sense! I recommend this Draft Policy be approved and formalized so that inter-agency cooperation can result in further realizing compatible and sustainable solutions which are truly in the best collective interest of the species, personnel, and agency Missions involved!

12,2,"From fiscal year 2004 through 2013, Federal agencies published 37,022 final rules in the Federal Register.
Excessive and unnecessary regulations can place undue burdens on companies, consumers, and workers, and may cause growth and overall productivity to slow. Evidence suggests that past administrations domestic environmental regulation has led some U.S.-based multinationals to invest in other nations especially in manufacturing, , such regulation had a adverse effect on domestic growth. There is widespread belief that new or more stringent environmental regulations raise production costs thereby reducing production which in turn must lead to lower employment (""output effect""). 
During the last Administration, significant and escalating regulatory burden was apparent , costs of regulation and realms subject to regulation have grown, while benefits remain ambiguous; entire sectors of society experience regulation from independent agencies that get little scrutiny; Federal Register page counts occupy record heights; economically significant and major rules reviewed annually have increased notably over the past decade; regulatory dark matter outside the normal notice and comment procedure lacks adequate scrutiny.
The Regulatory Right-to-Know Act calls for an analysis of the effects of regulations on small business. In the findings section of SBREFA, Congress states that ""small businesses bear a disproportionate share of regulatory costs and burdens.""
Primary task is to double GDP, rather than to double spending or regulatory burdens . Overreach by bureaucracy and the administrative state may not only impede economic efficiency but also undermine health, safety, and environmental progress. Healthy government requires recognizing downsides to coercive intervention; it requires vigilant legislative and executive institutions and mindsets that seek reasons not to add yet another rule or decree to the existing tens of thousands. Public has a right to know the ways federal agencies have harmed and harm that which they oversee, and how those negatives may propagate beyond the agency throughout the economy and society.
Past Rules with the highest estimated costs, come from the EPA, and in particular its Office of Air and Radiation. EPA rules account for 46 to 56 percent of the monetized costs. The annualized estimated cost is $9.6 billion ($2007, using discount rates of 3% and 7%). 2016 was much greater. . EPA's 2006 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM, with estimated costs of $3 billion per year using 2001 dollars. Far greater today. The Utility MACT rule, which is estimated to be the costliest of the EPA rules, has annualized costs of about $8.2 billion using 2001 dollars. Far greater today. Department of Labor rules taken together could range from about $2.2 billion to $19.1 billion per year (in 2001$)
An important source of uncertainty in the case of health and safety regulations is how to value the regulations' expected reduction in risks to life. Agencies vary in how they estimate the value of a statistical life (VSL), which is best understood not as the ""valuation of life,"" but as the valuation of statistical mortality risks. Differential toxicity among of PM, EPA, and concluded that the scientific evidence is not yet sufficient to allow differentiation of benefits estimates by particle type, if any. Uncertainty in the PM benefits estimates because a significant portion of the benefits associated with Obama admin. rules are from projected exposure reductions. Two of the particulate matter science experts in 2005 specifically highlighted the uncertainty associated with the fine PM. Source of uncertainty is the assumptions used in projecting the health impact of reducing PM. These projections are based on series of models that take into account emissions changes, resulting distributions of changes in ambient air quality, the estimated reductions in health effects from changes in exposure, and the composition of the population that will benefit from reduced exposure. Component includes assumptions, each with significant level of uncertainty. Although discussed qualitatively in EPA's regulatory impact analyses, assumption carries uncertainty that is not accounted for in the analysis presented in EPA's benefits estimates. Uncertainty differ across individual rules, aggregating high and low-end estimates can result in totals that may be misleading.
Past Admin regulation process did not provide accuracy of prospective analyses in a way that can be brought to bear on such analyses when they are originally written.

And it works 100% of the time.
Advantages of Hydropower:
Hydropower is fueled by water, so it's a clean fuel source, meaning it won't pollute the air or water with Rare earth elements in wind and solar, it does not kill wildlife like wind and solar . 
Hydroelectric power is a domestic source of energy, allowing each state to produce their own energy without being reliant on international fuel sources.
The energy generated through hydropower relies on the water cycle, which is driven by the sun, making it a renewable power source, making it a more reliable and affordable source than wind which only works 15 to 35 percent of time, or solar with no storage and dams are cost less for consumers electric bills.
Impoundment hydropower creates reservoirs that offer a variety of recreational opportunities, notably fishing, swimming, and boating. Most water power installations are required to provide some public access to the reservoir to allow the public to take advantage of these opportunities. 
Some hydropower facilities can quickly go from zero power to maximum output. Because hydropower plants can generate power to the grid immediately, they provide essential back-up power during major electricity outages or disruptions.
In addition to a sustainable fuel source, hydropower efforts produce a number of benefits, such as flood control, irrigation, and water supply.
Many dams were built for other purposes and hydropower was added later. In the United States, there are about 80,000 dams of which only 2,400 produce power. The other dams are for recreation, stock/farm ponds, flood control, water supply, and irrigation.

In the absence of effective regulatory regimes at the state level (comparable to the ones at the state level for non-federal dams), the repair and rebuilding of many locally owned levees after a flood often falls on the Federal government and the U.S. taxpayer. Title IX of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, and section 3106 of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014, may provide a way to address this concern. A primary purpose of these provisions was to build capabilities within the states for MORE DAMS for levee safety, as well as to develop national guidelines and align federal programs.

More than 180,000 people were evacuated in California because storms caused serious damage to the Oroville Dam, the tallest dam in the United States.

Dams and levees across the country NEED to be modernized and maintained if we are to prevent future disasters Dams and levees and out of control wildfires, DAMS across the country need to be modernized and maintained if we are to prevent future disasters... RECREATION; Dams provide prime recreational facilities throughout the United States. Boating, skiing, camping, picnic areas, and boat launch facilities are all supported by dams. FLOOD CONTROL; In addition to helping farmers, dams help prevent the loss of life and property caused by flooding. Flood control dams impound floodwaters and then either release them under control to the river below the dam or store or divert the water for other uses. For centuries, people have built dams to help control devastating floods.

Dams produce over 103,800 megawatts of renewable electricity and meet 8 to 12 percent of the Nation's power needs. Hydropower is considered clean because it does not contribute to global warming, air pollution, acid rain, or ozone depletion.

16,6,"Wildlife group having conducted more than 30 years of migratory bird research along Lake Erie, the six-turbine Icebreaker project would pose a significant threat to wildlife and substantially increased impacts that would be triggered by the planned expansion of the project to more than 1,000 turbines."" Organizations highlighted five major concerns which were submitted to the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy: 1.The proposed Icebreaker project site is approximately seven miles from the Lake Erie shoreline, near Cleveland, Ohio. Five recent advanced radar studies conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have recorded vast numbers of migratory birds and bats within 5 to 10 miles of the Great Lakes shorelines, including Lake Erie. Many were flying within the rotor-swept area of wind turbines. Globally Important Bird Area (IBA): The Ohio waters of the Central Basin of Lake Erie registered with BirdLife International and the National Audubon Society as globally significant habitat for birds this should automatic trigger detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), instead of a cursory EA. 2.assessment cites outdated studies and ignores new data. These data show that the species uses the airspace of central Lake Erie almost exclusively for its fall migration. The site selected for the Icebreaker project turbines could put the entire world population of this rare species at risk. 3.To reach the little to no impact conclusion, the industry assessors relied on limited visual surveys conducted only during daytime and in good weather to conclude that migrating birds fly at a height of turbines' blades.songbirds and most bats migrate at night. The risk from wind energy facilities is greater , heavy rain, fog, or low cloud cover, which can affect flight altitude and bring them within the rotor-swept area of the turbines. 4.The assessment erroneously concludes that migratory birds and bats avoid crossing Lake Erie, instead flying around it. ""Anyone watching birds on the shore of Lake Erie can see that birds do in fact fly over the water. Studies also large numbers of migratory birds and bats cross the lake, many of them making the long journey after stopping at the shoreline to rest and feed."" 5. The EA fails to acknowledge similar existing or planned projects throughout the Great Lakes that could increase the cumulative impacts on birds and bats an evaluation required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). What happens with the Icebreaker project could set an important precedent for the Great Lakes region on both sides of the border. Ontario, for instance, has placed a moratorium on any open water wind facilities in Lake Erie until Icebreaker is decided. hope that these concerns will be reflected in any future assessments of the environmental impact of Icebreaker and other proposed offshore wind energy development in the Great Lakes. ""Environmental assessments are intended to evaluate risks to public trust resources like wildlife before projects move forward,"" no more based on inadequate studies that contradict easily observable facts and ignore up-to-date science and cumulative impacts. we need to do much better to minimize impacts to birds and other wildlife."" ...

17,7,"Unprecedented numbers"" BATS been killed by wind turbines. United Nations has designated 2011-2012 the International Year of the Bat. . Bats play an important role in many environments around the world. Some plants depend partly or wholly on bats to pollinate their flowers or spread their seeds, while other bats also help control pests by eating insects. 
Recent research determined that free-tails are so effective that they save south-central Texas farmers up to $1.7 million a year in pesticide costs, the BCI reports. Mexican free-tailed bat, common in Texas, will reach an altitude of 1,000 feet to snare crop-destroying corn earworm mothsThe corn earworm moth (or more specifically, the moths' larvae) cause major damage to U.S. corn crops. Researchers from Southern Illinois University (SIU) wanted to find out what happens when bats aren't allowed to feed freely on the moths, so they built large outdoor enclosures over cornfields in Southern Illinois. The enclosures were covered in nets that let insects in but kept bats out. The corn grown within the enclosures had significantly more larvae-damaged kernels - by 56 percent - and less fungal damage. The researchers noted that bats ""suppress pest-associated fungal growth and mycotoxin in corn"" as well as increased crop yield by 1.4 percent, which adds up to a difference of more than $3 an acre. study found that bats save farmers more than $1 billion worldwide - and that's only for corn crops. The estimate also doesn't factor in other benefits that bats provide, such as a reduction in pesticide use. Study author Josiah Maine told BBC News: In 2011, University of Tennessee at Knoxville researchers also analyzed the economic importance of bats in agriculture. 
Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville These estimates include the reduced costs of pesticide applications that are not needed to suppress the insects consumed by bats. bats help pollinate and disperse seeds, they can even play an important part in helping regrowth after forest clearance. Without bats, crop yields are affected. Pesticide applications go up. Even if our estimates were quartered, they clearly show how bats have enormous potential to influence the economics of agriculture and forestry."" While some bats provide pest control, nectar-feeding pats act as beneficial pollinators. Giant cacti and agave are just two types of plants that depend on bats for pollination, and in the tropics over 500 different types of tropical plants are pollinated by bats every year. Fruit-eating bats are sometimes called the farmers of the tropics because they are incredibly efficient at dispersing seeds. They're especially essential to regenerating clear-cut forests, which requires seeds to be dropped over large, open spaces - areas where birds are reluctant to fly. Bats cover large distances while feeding at night and defecate while flying, which means the seeds in their feces are scattered across the vast open expanses of clear-cut rainforests they can add still more, different seeds to the mix that can lead eventually to a renewed forest. Bats have been reported dispersing the seeds of avocado, dates, figs, and cashews - vital part of a healthy eco-system, bats are beneficial mammals that contribute greatly to their surrounding ecosystems, and they deserve respect to go along with it. Bats devour tons of crop-destroying insects, a benefit that undeniably helps farmers get food to our tables. They also feed on mosquitoes, which is why I'm cheering for bats to occupy the bat houses I've put up in my yard. Bats fly at speeds of around 60 mph and sometimes at an altitude of 10,000 feet.

Particulate matter is the principal pollutant of concern from wildfire smoke. these particles are within the fine particle PM2.5 fraction and can be inhaled into the deepest recesses of the lung and may represent a greater health concern than larger particles.

Section 701 of H.R. 2936 improves the Tribal Forest Protection Act (TFPA). The TFPA, authorized by Congress 13 years ago, authorized the Forest Service and BLM to enter into agreements or contracts with tribes to address risks and threats originating on nearby Forest Service and BLM administered lands. the TFPA has not met expectations on the ground. Since 2004, only a handful of TFPA projects have been effectively implemented on Forest Service lands. One project proposed by the Tule River Tribe took over ten years to navigate the Forest Service's environmental review process. providing timelines for review, approval and implementation of old growth projects on federal land. litigious environmental activist , and a lack of sufficient agency focus on this challenge has led to million acres in California to get out of control. These areas of let it burn policy of past administration is high risk of deadly and catastrophic forest fires that endanger communities, hurt local economies, destroy land and water quality and release massive amounts of emissions into the atmosphere. the causes of catastrophic wildfire are complex of old trees, dead bushes, etc, the status quo of inaction has exacerbated present forest conditions, which now present a great risk to both communities and the environment. Stop the environmental activist that are preventing forest service and BLM from doing their jobs. 
Direct and comprehensive management of our forests must be revised.Must understand that a ""let it burn"" approach is not acceptable given the forest health conditions found across our nation's landscape. Instead we are need effectively responding to and reversing unnatural conditions in the forest, also respond to fires more effectively before they start by cleaning old growth allowing more timber sales. If forests are devastated by wildfire, we lose revenue and jobs, a myriad of ecological benefits we rely upon from our forests, and the traditional and cultural sustenance our forests have provided since time immemorial. Wild Fires create a toxic health risk to humans and wildlife. While the comparison is not completely equivalent, the average size of a fire on BIA-managed lands is one-third the size of fires on Forest Service land. Fire fuels in forest need weekly or monthly inspection team to respond to old growth to stop fires from damaging economic value and rehabilitate landscapes. Fires once start can come at a devastating financial and ecological cost. Rehabilitation costs are generally equal to the suppression cost, but can be as much as three times higher.

EPA efforts to regulate carbon emissions from power plants were driven by Obama Administration officials and ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST groups who worked to fulfill Obama climate commitments pages 15-17, 29, 50,56. EPA rushed into a ""sue-and-settle"" agreement with Natural Resources Defense Council, other environmental activists, and several state and local governments in 2010 to issue unprecedented carbon regulations with LITTLE REGARD to the technical, legal, and policy challenges that rules would present. pages 14-19, 21, 26, 30-39, 45-48, 56,61. EPA played politics with regulatory process by trying to manipulate rulemaking deadlines to avoid a public backlash close to 2012 Presidential and 2014 midterm elections, and to push implementation to next Administration, pages 16, 17, 31-34, 40-49, 55,64. The carbon rules were the product of quintessential ""sue-and-settle"" scheme where EPA and environmental activists, such as NRDC, continued to negotiate BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, changing regulatory actions and deadlines without providing the public meaningful notice or opportunity to comment. pages 17-19, 24, 26, 31,40-45 Obama EPA officials repeatedly MISLED the American people, news media, and Congress about negotiations with environmental activists and contribution made by these activists to development of carbon rules. pages 4-6,43, 47, 48, 54, 62-64,67. The White House, EPA, and environmental activists worked together to manage the public message on the carbon rules. pages 28-29, 33-35, 39, 46, 47, 50-51, 54,68. The litigation settlement provided environmental activists significant leverage to drive timing of EPA's rulemaking and to influence scope of its policies.pages 30-32, 35, 40-46, 67 EPA's process for developing the carbon rules appears to have DEVIATED FROM THE AGENCY STATUTORY AUTHORITY under the Clean Air Act and established policies and circumvented transparency laws and public participation requirements. pages 22, 23, 28, 32, 43, 48-49, 62-64. NRDC and other environmental activist groups have worked with EPA to shore up the shaky basis for carbon rules, issuing public statements criticizing opponents of rule and submitting detailed legal analyses for EPA to rely on and cite in its rulemaking documents. pages 59-68 . EPA and environmental activists had cozy relationships and egregiously used personal emails and held meetings away from EPA headquarters, thereby avoiding public transparency. pages 20, 22, 25, 28, 39, 43, 48,54-56. In addition to detailing overt ""sue-and-settle"" tactics, Report reveals how environmental activist groups including Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and EPA INAPPROPRIATELY coordinated a public message on climate. The Administration went out of its way to mislead the American public about the timing and scope of these rules, stating repeatedly that it had ""no plans"" to regulate existing power plants even though it had been working behind scenes with its environmental allies to do it. Only after his reelection did Obama intervene to set in motion EPA action that would fulfill his original climate campaign promises before leaving office. Environmentalists proved to be big cheerleaders for Obama and EPA, but groups such as NRDC were basically an extension of the Agency, providing policy advice, data and modeling, legal counsel.

20,10,"According to data made available since the beginning of the Obama Administration, federal and state expenditures have continued to rise steadily, totaling $6.2 billion between Fiscal Years 2009 and 2012. These costs do not include the soaring direct and indirect costs on local governments and the private sector. Another recent, egregious example is the FWS's handling of the endangered Desert Tortoise, some of which were housed in a $1 million budgeted conservation center at the southern edge of Las Vegas Valley in Nevada. Though the tortoise has been ESA-listed since 1990, when available funds to operate the conservation reserve center decreased, the FWS began plans to actually kill hundreds of tortoises rather than finding other protection methods. ""It's the lesser of two evils, but it's still evil,"" said the FWS program recovery coordinator. 
 FWS has taken position that it is not required to act on delisting of a species unless and until an ""interested party"" petitions for action and then follows up with a lawsuit. Because most citizens do not desire or are not in a position to file petitions or lawsuits against the federal government, many species continue to be listed under ESA even when it may not be necessary.
Two Utah counties and private landowners have been unable to control an influx of prairie dogs that have destroyed private lands because the FWS only counts prairie dogs found on public lands, not private lands, for recovery purposes. This interpretation has cost one rural electric cooperative over $150,000 to airlift transmission poles around federal lands that have been designated for Utah prairie dogs, despite private landowners being able to obtain permits to kill them on nearby lands.
 Agencies are faced with a no-win situation; they are overwhelmed by environmental activists with hundreds of candidate listings that agency cannot possibly respond to in statutory timeline specified; they then find themselves in violation of that statute and subsequently sued by these same groups who filed to protect the species. These activists create the problem by purposely overwhelming the agency, knowing that they will be unable to respond and then dictate an outcome because the agency settles rather than being able to follow the appropriate proves, including the study of scientific evidence. Listing a species without adequate scientific data, just to settle a lawsuit is capricious.
 The ESA has existed for over 40 years, with less than 2% of species removed from the ESA list in 40 years. Federal government could recover and delist three dozen species with the resources they spend responding to litigation. only 94 listed species out of the total 2,097 listed species are in the ocean, ""a historic imbalance needs to be righted to ""stem the extinction crisis in the world's oceans. ESA has not been updated by Congress in over a quarter century. 
Time to change, Concerns have been raised that ESA does not ensure that economic impacts are fairly quantified at time of listing, despite at least one circuit court of appeals mandate to this effect. . critical habitat designations have been ""fish in the barrel litigation for folks. ESA are unable to make basic and legitimate data used for listings and critical habitat available to the public.
ESA litigation has also increased federal government's inability to control catastrophic wildfires. Four federal land management agencies (the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and the FWS) are responsible for managing over 600 million acres of land or nearly one-third of the United States. Decades of failed federal forest management have created unhealthy and overstocked forests, placing 73 million acres of National Forest lands and 397 million acres of forest land nationwide at risk of severe wildfire. Fires are destroying species habitat and ESA itself is creating obstacles that are counter-productive to fighting wildfires, including use of heavily mechanized equipment, use of aerial retardant and restricted use of water due to concerns about potential impacts to other ESA-listed species, such as spruce goose, salmon and others. State and tribal lands adjoining federal forest lands are increasingly at risk of wildfires partly because of ESA. Forest Service's self-described ""analysis paralysis,"" excessive appeals on timber sales, ESA-related litigation, statutory and administrative land designations (such as wilderness, roadless areas and critical habitat) all serve to delay or outright block management activities necessary to reduce hazardous fuels and improve forest health and habitat. Over the past fiscal years alone, 26 lawsuits, notices of lawsuits, and appeals were filed in the Idaho and Montana region of the U.S. Forest Service to block timber thinning and other vegetation management in areas at high risk of wildfire.

22,2,"

Past administration with environmental activist hoax of man-made global warming designed a paradigm for false science and its dependence on fear based support may not constitute exploitation per se, but it does serve to make the system particularly vulnerable to dishonesty. Extraordinarily shallow basis for the commitment to climate catastrophe, and the widespread tendency of scientists to use unscientific means to arouse the public's concerns, is becoming increasingly evident, and the result is a reversal of the trust that arose from the triumphs of science and technology in the 1940s. Only thing climate change was envisioned ; to put American companies out of business and American workers in the unemployment line, by depressing economic output, keep companies from creating jobs and drive billions of American dollars out of the country. Climate change would ultimately have little effect on our environment. At a time when American companies are already successfully reducing their carbon emissions, we don't need another government regulation restricting our economy's ability to grow. Changes in the structure of scientific activity over the past half century have led to extreme vulnerability to political manipulation. In the case of climate change, these vulnerabilities have been exploited to a remarkable extent. 

The dangers that situation poses for both science and society are too numerous to be discussed in any sort of adequate way but It should be stressed that the climate change issue, itself, constitutes a major example of the dangers intrinsic to the structural changes in science. There is little question that global warming has been exploited many governments and corporations heavily promoting global warming alarm, and relying on the advice they pick for their own purposes, but it is clear extent such exploitation has played an initiating role in the issue. The developing world has come to realize that the proposed measures endanger their legitimate hopes to escape poverty, and, in the case of India, they had, encouragingly, led to an assessment of climate issues independent of the 'official' wisdom. Concerns that specific dangers pertaining to speculation about climate change which we are already seeing that the tentative policy moves associated with 'climate mitigation' are contributing to deforestation, food riots, industry closing, tax payer money going to unanticipated nations or companies, potential trade wars, inflation, technology speculation and overt corruption . Reliance by the scientific community on fear as a basis for support, may, indeed, have severely degraded the ability of science to usefully address problems that need addressing. Although society is undoubtedly aware of the imperfections of science, it has rarely encountered a situation such as the current global warming hysteria where institutional science has so thoroughly committed itself to policies which call for massive sacrifices in well being world wide. 

Example of a bad policy takes money from one nations to the benefit of another : An economist from India and long term UN bureaucrat in the IPCC had urged westerners to reduce meat consumption in order to save the earth from destruction by global warming. We have the new paradigm where simulation and programs have replaced theory and observation, where government largely determines the nature of scientific activity, and where the primary role of professional societies is the lobbying of the government for special advantage.

The current support mechanisms for science is one where the solution of a scientific problem is rewarded by ending support. This hardly encourages the solution of problems or the search for actual answers. Nor does it encourage meaningfully testing hypotheses. The alternative calls for a measure of societal trust, patience, and commitment to elitism that hardly seems consonant with the contemporary attitudes. It may, however, be possible to make a significant beginning by removing the funding for regulations. 

Change in scientific culture has played an important role in making science more vulnerable to exploitation by nations and politics, the resolution of specific issues may be possible without explicitly addressing the structural problems in science. In the US, where global warming has become enmeshed in partisan politics, there is a natural opposition to exploitation which is not specifically based on science itself. The restoration of the traditional scientific paradigm will call for more serious efforts. Such changes are unlikely to come from any fiat. Nor is it likely to be implemented by the large science bureaucracies that have helped create the problem in the first place.

23,3,"By resending and repealing many of the past administration rules and regulation on oil and gas and mining in the USA will see increase in GDP resulting from shale development and increased federal tax revenues for the 2018 budget, and it will continue to do so. Estimates that federal tax revenues will be in the billions higher in 2020 , and even higher in 2040 with the development of exporting LNG . Shale production also contributes to federal receipts through payments that the developers of federally owned resources make to the governmentbut that contribution can increase by reducing more Regulations that hurt American workers. Increase the shale resources on federal lands will reduce Americas need to import from nations not friendly . Working from EIA's projections of the future production of tight oil and shale gas, and also from its own forecasts of oil and natural gas prices, CBO estimates that federal royalties from shale (minus the amounts that the federal government transfers to the states) will be in the hundreds of million annually by 2020. The technological innovations behind hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling make existing labor and capital whether they are employed in shale development, in industries using natural gas or oil, or in industries using products derived from natural gas or oilmore productive than they otherwise would be. That heightened productivity has increased gross domestic product (GDP) and will continue to do so. The increases in GDP associated with increased productivity would spur further increases in GDP by increasing the supplies of labor and capital. As GDP rises, households have more income to save and invest; most of the additional savings are invested domestically. That investment increases the capital stock, thus increasing the economy's productive capacity and raising GDP. In addition, higher labor productivity is reflected in higher wages, which encourage people to work and lead to an increase in the number of hours worked, likewise raising GDP. The two effects reinforce each other: A larger capital stock boosts labor productivity and wages, and an increase in the number of hours worked increases saving and investment.

Higher employment resulting from shale development, along with a larger capital stock resulting from increased investment in the development and use of shale resources, will led to higher household income and thus greater demand for goods and services. Some of that increased demand will be met by the additional production from the energy-intensive industries.

Shale development also boosts GDP in other ways. The increase in GDP represents increased income, which allows people and firms to save and invest more in productive capital, and the higher productivity increases wages, raising the amount of labor available. Both the increased capital and the increased labor raise GDP for America. In addition, in the near term, shale development causes labor and capital to be used that would otherwise be idle, again raising GDP. In the longer term, shale resources, labor and capital available in the economy will be used at roughly their maximum sustainable rates without regulations, so the additional labor and capital used to produce shale resources or energy-intensive goods will be great for American Middle class.

The exploration and development of natural gas resources provides method of serving the public's need for energy. Natural gas consumption comprises approximately 23 percent of the total energy consumption in the United States. Natural gas is used for many purposes: home space and water heating; cooking; commercial and industrial space heating; commercial and industrial processes; as a raw material for the manufacture of fertilizer, plastics, and petrochemicals; as vehicle fuel; and for electric generation. The Marcellus Shale formation has attracted attention as a significant source of natural gas production. The Marcellus Shale extends from Ohio and West Virginia into Pennsylvania and New York. In New York, the Marcellus Shale is located in much of the Southern Tier and adjoining areas, stretching from Chautauqua and Erie Counties in the west to the counties of Sullivan, Ulster, Greene and Albany in the east.

I am writing on behalf of Sequoia Riverlands Trust (SRT) to support the designation of accredited land trusts as entities qualified to hold mitigation real estate interests, such as conservation easements, under Section 8.3 of the proposed Endangered Species Act Compensatory Mitigation Policy.

SRT is a regional, accredited land trust that conserves habitat and farmland in California's Southern Sierra, Southern San Joaquin Valley and Carrizo Plain, including but not limited to lands set aside as compensatory mitigation for the impacts of transportation and renewable energy projects. To join the ranks of accredited land trusts, we went through a rigorous review process examining our organizational structure, leadership and finances; our policies, procedures and recordkeeping systems for land transactions; and our ability to provide lasting stewardship for the lands we conserve. Going through this process, and maintaining our accredited status by actively adhering to Land Trust Alliance Standards and Practices, has strengthened SRT as an organization, and reinforced both our commitment and our ability to conserve mitigation lands in perpetuity. We believe that the same is true of other accredited land trusts, and strongly support the designation of accredited land trusts as entities qualified to hold mitigation real estate interests.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

The updating of the Endangered Species Act Compensatory Mitigation Policy in 2016 was an important step forward for conservation. Specifically, creating a policy that applied across FWS offices reduced regulatory burden on industry, while the updated policy of ""net gain"" protected the public's interest in conserving endangered species. The ""net gain"" policy should be retained, as it will increase the likelihood that endangered species will recover and be delisted, which is the ultimate goal of the Endangered Species Act.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0220,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">quick</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> over the <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span><i></i>"

DAMS should be built to protect the waters from pollution, protect wildlife habitat , provide resources for Farms, Help with Wildfires, Provide for the local population, EPA reported in the past that , states with so many potential sources of pollution, it is difficult and expensive for States to identify specific sources responsible for water quality impairments. Many States lack funding for monitoring to identify all but the most apparent sources degrading waterbodies. State management priorities may focus monitoring budgets on other water quality issues. Management priorities may also direct monitoring efforts to larger waterbodies and overlook sources impairing smaller waterbodies. As a result, the States do not associate every impacted waterbody with a source of impairment in their 305(b) reports. Also the BLM reported in past years, that some states have been deficient in reporting actual work performed dams , and in some cases inspections have not been performed on low hazard dams. IF states did not reporting correctly , I think we need to start fresh and rescind past rules and regulations. Let the new administration work for American taxpayers.

To protect public health and welfare of neighbor states by reducing interstate emission transport that significantly contributes to nonattainment, or interferes with maintenance, of the 2008 ozone NAAQS in the western U.S. Wildfire greenhouse gas causes a variety of negative effects on human health, vegetation, and ecosystems. In humans, acute and chronic exposure to ozone is associated with premature mortality and a number of morbidity effects, such as asthma exacerbation. Wildfire Ozone exposure can also negatively impact ecosystems, for example, by limiting tree growth. Studies have established that ozone occurs on a regional scale (i.e., hundreds of miles) over much of the California with elevated concentrations occurring in rural as well as metropolitan areas. To reduce this regional-scale ozone transport, assessments of ozone control approaches have concluded that NOX control strategies are effective. Further, studies have found that EGU NOX wildfire emission reductions can be effective in reducing ozone pollution.

29,9,"Protect Habitat cut and thin before fires. The immensity of greenhouse gas emissions from California wildfires has been a warning for years. the causes of catastrophic wildfire are complex of old trees, dead bushes, etc, the status quo of inaction has exacerbated present forest conditions, which now present a great risk to both communities and the environment. If managed wisely, and remove the environmental activists that has stop forest personal from cutting old growth. America's national forests can provide clean water, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and abundant domestic supplies of wood products and support rural communities and thousands of jobs in the timber industry. Clearly, we must make every effort to reduce the amount of excess biomass in forests to prevent catastrophic wildfires. That means decreasing the number of trees by thinning to make them more resistant to crown fires, which will also restore the natural health and diversity of our forests. Reducing the number and severity of wildfires may be the single most important action we can take in the short-term to lower greenhouse gas emissions and fight global warming. The catastrophic wildfires that ravage California each year don't resemble the historic fires that took place in these forests for millennia. Just too many over grown bushes and trees. They exceed emissions that would have occurred in historic fires because the biomass available to burn is so much greater than it was in natural forests. Consequently wildfires, when the massive amounts of fuel in these forests burned, they released an estimated 9.5 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere just from combustion. That is an average of about 63 tons per acre. However, combustion is only part of the story because dead trees also gradually release CO2 as they decay. CO2 emissions from decay are generally three times greater than emissions from combustion because large quantities of wood and other plant material remain unburned after a forest fire. Combining combustion and decay emissions. Estimates that fires will emit a staggering 38 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Fires released one fourth of the gases during combustion, and post-fire decay will release the remainder during the next 100 years, most of it during the next 50 years. Wildfire gaseous pollutants are precursors for ozone (O3) production. California should be required to limit wildfire NOx emissions to reduce ozone, and to limit annual NOx and SO2 emissions to reduce fine particle pollution. Mercury emissions from forest fires (QHg) (in kg of mercury per year) can be estimated following a bottom-up approach by the equation: contribute substantial emissions of gases and particles to the atmosphere. 
Over the years, outside the regulatory process, well-funded special interest groups have use lawsuits to force federal agencies to issue regulations that advance their priorities. At some point, this exercise of ""Sue-and-Settle"" and the practice of acquiescence through consent decrees or settlement agreements, which were often crafted behind closed doors and without the transparency of the rulemaking process, became all too common, paying tens of thousands of dollars in attorney's fees to these groups with which were settled. More transparent process in which impacted parties and states have a voice and creates more awareness for the general public is needed. Policies and rules should reflect common sense, consistent with statutory authorities so the public will benefit from greater un-regulatory providing economic certainty not the Environment activist .
REFORM The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) . Revise Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA). GREATER use of Regulatory Flexibility Act to assess rules effects on small businesses. BETTER USE OF REINS Act expedited congressional vote on all major or significant rules before they are effective. REFORM National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Wildfires need to be included in EPA issued rules in 2012 and early 2016 to control emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to address safety . These emissions can impact air quality and even climate.

Forestry issues on Harvesting and sale should be considerable significance to the United States. In 1995 USA had 5 percent of the Earth's population and consumes an estimated 28 percent of the Earth's industrial wood products. Although domestic timber inventory is only 10 percent of the Earth's total, 96 percent of U.S. consumption of industrial wood comes from domestic supplies. By 1910, the area of forest land had declined to an estimated 754 million acres, or 34 percent of the total land area. In 2012, forest land comprised 766 million acres, or 33 percent of the total land area of the United State. Forest area has been relatively stable since 1910, although the population has more than tripled since then. Of the total forest land, 10 percent are classified as reserved. This classification indicates that these forest lands are not managed for timber harvest, which is prohibited by law on these lands in most cases. Reserved forests have changed very little since 2007, with a very small (2 percent) reduction in area. Nationwide, reserved forest area is more than three times what it was only 59 years ago. Most reserved land is in the West, reflecting a larger proportion of publicly owned land in that region. In general, U.S. private forest land is classified as ""timber land"" by FIA, even if landowners do not intend to harvest timber. The South contains 40 percent of the Nation's 521 million acres of timber land. 
In contrast, the West constitutes only 28 percent of national timber land, and the North 32 percent. Time for change to timber sales to stop fuel build. The South is often referred to as the ""woodbasket"" of the United States because of the extensive timber supply, ( yet few fires). 
West is host to most of the Nation's reserved forest and national parks. ( time for change to timber sales to stop fires ). Other woodlands, including scrub forests, are found in the highest concentrations in the West. U.S. forest ownership patterns are quite diverse with public forests dominant in the West. Federal Government predominantly owns public forest lands in the West and State and county governments own most of the public lands in the East. Of all public forest acres, 75 percent are in the West. Removals have shifted in recent years from public lands in the West to private lands in the East. Recent studies show that only 8 percent of the families and individuals who own U.S. forest land have a written management plan. Private forests provided 88 percent of the Nation's timber harvest in 2011. In 2001, the forest industry owned 66 million acres (13 percent) of the Nation's 504 million acres of timber land but supplied 29 percent of wood production.
 Recent changes in corporate strategies have shifted the traditional view of industrial forests. Age of timber, In the South, where more acres of short-rotation yellow pine trees are planted, 51 percent of timber land is less than 40 years old compared with 20 percent in the North and 22 percent in the West. 
In contrast, 56 percent of northern timber land is more than 60 years old, compared with 27 percent in the South and 69 percent in the West. In the West, hemlock-Sitka spruce forests and ponderosa pine have declined since 1977, while western pine forests have increased. In the West, planting is generally used to augment natural regeneration. In recent years, western U.S. forest planting has subsided, a trend that mirrors reduced harvesting in that region. U.S. timber land growing stock inventory, growth, removals, and mortality, by region.
 Inventory West in 1953 was 363,666 Million cubic feet, in 2012 inventory grew to 397,968 Million cubic feet. Removal in 1952 was 3,765 Million cubic feet in 2011 dropped to only 2,446 Million cubic feet, yet Mortality ( dead trees ) 1952 was 2,242 Million cubic feet and 2011 grew to 3,679 Million cubic feet. 
During the past 60 years, net growing-stock growth has consistently exceeded growing-stock removals in the United States. In terms of percent of standing volume, removals are at the lowest level in the past 60 years and growth has also slowed. The volume of annual net growth is currently 2 times higher than the volume of annual removals. Forest biomass consumption for energy has declined during the past several years.
 Mortality rates relative to inventory continue to rise in the West where mountain pine beetle affected millions of acres of forest between 2009 and 2010.

35,5,"Wind Farms are fields of killings bats and birds, why are agencies applying laws differently?... in just four years, more than a million bats have been killed. Even though many of these bats and birds are protected by laws such as the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty Act the ecological and economic importance of insectivorous bats in Agriculture are enormous. Renewable energy companies had enjoyed preferential treatment in the years of Obama Administration, including the ability to avoid compliance with laws. The increased development of wind-power facilities are threatening populations of insectivorous bats in North America. Bats are voracious predators of nocturnal insects, including many crop and forest pests. Loss of bats in North America could lead to agricultural losses estimated at more than $3.7 billion/year. Bats play an incredibly important role in the ecosystem, eating billions of crop-destroying insects like moths and beetles, as well as mosquitoes. But The Indiana bat is a temperate, insectivorous, migratory bat. In spring, reproductive females migrate and form maternity colonies where they bear and raise their young in wooded areas. 
Bats help Farmers with impacts of PESTICIDES on ecosystems,... which can be substantial ,... or other secondary effects of predation, such as reducing the potential for evolved resistance of insects to PESTICIDES and bats help suppression of forest insects. A single colony of 150 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in Indiana has been estimated to eat nearly 1.3 million pest insects each year, possibly contributing to the disruption of population cycles of agricultural pests. Man get so much from these bats and birds by pollinating plants and spreading seeds in the ecosystems. 
Example of preferential treatment Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System project near the California and Nevada border. In addition to the clear cronyism displayed on this project, the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System project serves as a textbook example of how far this Administration is willing to bend over backwards for its friends at the expense of others. Owners were granted federal money to build the Ivanpah project in an area that ""served as prime desert tortoise habitat,"" which resulted in tortoise casualties. The tortoises, which are federally listed as threatened, are not the only casualties of Ivanpah as project biologists reported the killing of 76 birds in the final three months of last year alone. In addition, the Ivanpah project had been labeled a risk to air safety due to an unsafe glare coming from the thousands of billboard-sized mirrors ""nearly blinding"" pilots. As if killing animals, endangering the lives of aircraft passengers, and perpetuating the revolving door of cronyism.

Wind turbines development might be in violation Article 14, Section 4 of the New York State Constitution,
Prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), is particularly vulnerable to wind farms, it's the chicken's innate fear of looming, vertical structures that has made turbines so disastrous. Bird populations are among the fastest declining on the continent, and the turbine is the aggressor to swat native species out of existence. Low-frequency noise produced by wind turbines could interfere with the vocalizations of male prairie chickens, hens tended to move further away from any wind turbine, Wind energy is the only one that has a direct impact on birds . 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) bird deaths from turbine collisions are between 134,000 and 327,000 birds per year. 2015 The USFWS also believed that wind energy development was an increasing threat to native bird population indicated that bird populations declined.
At the UN conference in Bonn, researchers said wind turbines and power lines were a particular problem for migratory soaring birds.

36,6,"The objectives of federal water agencies in the United States, such as, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), FEMA, have forgot the core mission. These agencies were initially tasked with the water development role of building dams to expand navigable waters, Habit for Wildlife, control floods, and develop water supplies to encourage economic development. Today, many of the best sites from an engineering standpoint need improvements, and repairs. Dams for unappropriated water supplies are becoming increasingly scarce, the focus of these agencies should again be expanded to include dams for water management. Allocating water supplies between competing uses, including Farms , Ranches, Indian lands, Fishing, Boating, Recreation, power, energy, clean water, New Projects should be become an important objective of these agencies. Federal water development to focus primarily on new extractive or new consumptive, or non consumptive uses of the water. Elwha River of the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State and Glines Canyon Dams, Colorado River, Glen Canyon and Flaming Gorge, Snake River need to be restored for greater use of water. Inventory Dams for targeted recovery, More population requirements for all sources should encourage dam structural improvements and build new dams to increase the benefits for humans and wildlife. Significant effort and financial resources should be devoted for the next century. To reverse this trend of our system of dams, many believe that extraordinary efforts are required, suggesting that the only way to truly restore dams may be to managed state through dam Improvement rules . Their implicit assumption is that the general public would consider the return of these dams on rivers to help with water issues, the potential recovery, to be quite valuable even if they never intend to visit them. Estimation of these nonuse or passive use values are often required to justify dam. In addition to the local community, commercial, sport, and tribal fishers are also often supporters of dams . This is particularly true of river systems with fish, where dams have natural contributing factors to all populations. Indian Tribe may be allocated a significant share of a river dams system's allowable fish harvest for commercial, subsistence, and ceremonial purposes. From a recreation perspective, anglers may be supportive of dam given the potential for increased in fish populations. While most native fish populations would likely increase with more or expanded dams. Resident reservoir fisheries would also typically be increased. Furthermore, in certain naturally warm water river systems, such as the habitats have been stocked with trout, creating extremely valuable ""blue ribbon"" sport fisheries. Finally, resorts, vacationing and local residents boaters may also be interested in new dam with boating runs and increase seasonal enjoyment. Should also increase values for Famers and rancher for crops and animals. Low cost Energy for Cities and local towns will benefit. In the U.S., many dams were constructed in the early to mid-1900s. As dams age, maintenance and repair costs can be expected to increase substantially making current investments a high priority. Older dams need upgrading and or dredging to increase functional and water storage in reservoir as sediment accumulates . In addition, repair and maintenance may required structural stability of the dam, decreasing the potential for dam failure and associated losses in property damage and possibly human life. For privately owned dams substantial increase low interest loans for in the costs of repair. Expending money to build new facilities, makes economic sense to fix the old structure. As dams are determined to be improve based upon inspection, or come up for licensing renewal, proposals for dam repairs should undoubtedly increase benefits.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0188,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">quick</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span><i></i>"
37,7,"To put Wildfire emissions from combustion and decay into perspective, they are equivalent to adding an estimated 7 million more cars onto California's highways for one year, each spewing tons of greenhouse gases out tailpipe. Stated another way, this means 50 percent of all cars in California would have to be locked in a garage for one year to make up for global warming greenhouse gas impact of these wildfires. Greenhouse gas emissions from decay are generally larger than combustion emissions. The reason is that 3.67 times the carbon content of biomass is released as CO2 during decomposition. Therefore, forests emit more CO2 when they decay than when they burn because large quantities of biomass remain in the forest after combustion. However, chaparral and brush fields burn more completely, so combustion emissions can exceed decay emissions. Combining combustion and decay emissions provides a more complete picture of the impact of wildfires on global warming. In general, CO2 emissions from decay after a forest fire are three times the amount emitted during combustion. 
Timber sales are one big answer to compensate for greenhouse gas emissions from wildfires is to lower the amount of biomass available for decay. Removing dead trees and storing carbon they contain in solid wood products consumers need can reduce total CO2 emissions by 15 percent. with interim harvests for wood products after planting, effectively reverses impact of wildfire emissions on global warming. illustrate an opportunity that is still available to remove dead trees from public forestlands and to manufacture solid wood products before the trees lose their economic value. The money could be used to help pay for planting. This would restore these forests at minimal cost to the public, reduce and recover greenhouse gases from these wildfires, protect nearby communities from another wildfire, and help fight global warming. it is essential to remove dead trees. Not only does it make it safe to plant, but it also reduces emissions from decay by storing CO2 in solid wood products. Equally important, removing dead trees and replanting would help protect surrounding communities from a second wildfire, which is called a reburn, that often occurs in fire-killed forests that become brush fields filled with dead trees. Without money made available from harvesting and selling fire-killed trees, there is little chance that the Forest Service will be able to pay to remove dead trees, plant young trees, and manage the young forest by releasing overtopping brush to ensure that a brush field doesn't take over the area.
 Tree density, especially young trees growing under larger trees as ladder fuel, and surface fuels are the two most important contributors to the size and severity of wildfires. Most natural fires didn't sweep across landscapes destroying whole forests as wildfires do today. Underlying cause of modern catastrophic wildfires is overcrowded with trees or too many trees. with trees of all sizes intermixed to form a uniform mass of fuel spreading over the landscape. They averaged 350 trees per acre when 50-60 trees per acre would be natural. Those who have not stood in the midst of flames 200-feet high, felt the overwhelming heat from a temperature more than 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and smelled the smoke and gases released, cannot fully appreciate a catastrophic wildfire. It is awesome and terrible, and firefighters who brave these conditions deserve our respect.an industrialized world can't live with fire. We would have to move out of our forests to be safe and get out of our cars to eliminate tailpipe emissions to make up for the greenhouse gases that wildfires emit into the atmosphere. only solution is to fight and protect our communities and forests by reducing the threat of catastrophic wildfires. The Angora Fire of 2007 blackened 3,100 acres of forest and destroyed 254 homes in the Tahoe Basin because most of the forest was so dense. Estimates that combustion emissions could have been lowered from 46.2 tons per acre to 12 tons per acre if the density of trees had been reduced from 273 per acre to the more natural density of 60 per acre. A fire burning in the same forest after thinning would not have been catastrophic. It would have killed few large trees, covered less acreage, and left adjacent communities relatively unharmed. The Angora, Fountain, Moonlight, and Star Fires wildfires burned over 144,825 acres of forestland. Forest also contained unnaturally heavy surface fuels composed of litter, duff, down dead wood, shrubs, and small trees that ranged from an estimated 25 to 40 tons per acre. Tree density, especially young trees growing under larger trees as ladder fuel, and surface fuels are the two most important contributors to the size and severity of wildfires. The most important question is: Can we recover from our mistake of letting forests become unnaturally overcrowded with trees and vulnerable to catastrophic wildfire",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0229,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">quick</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> over the <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span><i></i>"
38,8,"Under ESA, anyone can submit unlimited petitions to the FWS or NMFS to list species as ""threatened"" or ""endangered."" There is no requirement that the agencies considering these petitions actually count the species populations prior to listing. Thus, there is no real measurable numerical goalpost to justify the agencies' determination that a species deserves to be listed or to justify what would be needed to recover them once they are listed. alternative approaches authorized by ESA to recover listed species, such as use of artificial propagation, are often ignored in favor of scapegoating human activity. Agricultural crop protection products that already undergo extensive regulation under one federal statute must go through consultation with FWS and NMFS, which have little expertise, resulting in consultation delays and litigation, a recent review of information reveals that more than 30% of all ""delisted"" species were removed from the ESA list due to data errors, indicating that they should never have been listed in the first place. Even when a species has been deemed recovered, certain Activists groups continue litigating to keep the species on the list. State and tribal representatives have expressed concern that federal proposed recovery timeframes are too lengthy and lack incentives for local, state and tribal entities to delist species, also, concerned that federal ESA recovery goals are being set too high, and that they include objectives unrelated to species, such as greenhouse gas emission targets. Litigious groups are petitioning for new species that lack even common names or descriptions, citing from a database called NatureServe, which is not reliable as an accurate or complete source of data. Too often, the ""science"" included in citizen listing petitions is directly relied upon in the 90-day findings and is then codified as ""fact"" by the time the 12-month review is completed, and 12-month reviews are sometimes subjected to ad hoc and informal peer reviews that may amount to no more than an email distribution of the document with informal comments received. NMFS created and has used a different means to quantify and classify populations of fish. NMFS characterizes populations of salmon and steelhead as ""evolutionary significant units,""116 whereas the FWS utilizes ""distinct population segments"" as defined by ESA under section 4. that FWS and NMFS have used less-than-transparent processes to ensure that they can list a population of species, even though doubts have been raised about the science underlying a listing proposal
ESA is bowing to out-of-the mainstream and unjustified agendas of certain groups. One Activists in 2010 states ""where humans multiply extinction follows, and that the planet cannot continue to sustain both an exponentially growing human population and the healthy abundance of other species."" One biologist went so far as to defend his statement that ""the collective needs of non-human species must take precedence over the needs and desires of humans."" Another stated that ""humanity threatens to turn the earth into a planet of weeds.""

40,10,"Challenging the Incidental Take Permit issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the windfarms in death of 100,000 of thousands of Bats and Birds. (this is NOT incidental), it is outrageous killing and harming migratory birds. wind turbines routinely kill federally protected birds and eagles. Much has changed in the knowledge of wind energy in the past five years, According to a study in the Wildlife Society Bulletin, every year 573,000 birds (including 83,000 raptors) and 888,000 bats are killed by wind turbines 30 percent higher than the federal government estimated in 2009 . Over the past five years, about 2.9 million birds were killed by wind turbines. The death of an eagle or other protected bird is a violation of federal law, unless a company has a federal permit. regulation that allows wind energy companies and others to obtain 30-year permits to kill eagles without prosecution by the federal government is not in public interest. Shiloh IV Wind Project in California, for example, received a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service allowing it to kill eagles, hawks, peregrine falcons, owls and songs birds while not being subjected to the normal prohibitions afforded under the federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Migratory Treaty Act. FW amendment process including a staff investigation, should bring to light new concerns about the construction on Wind Turbines with the increase in wildlife deaths, that were not addressed when any facility was authorized. investigation of an amendment is an important process to promote public participation and examination of potential harms to the public. Wind farms building would recommended any findings that include determinations of ""minimum adverse environmental impact"" and ""public interest, convenience, and necessity"" before approving a change. Or violated its own rules when it didn't conduct an past investigation. changes in Wind's construction staging locations, burial of electric power collection lines, and relocation of property access roads constitute a ""material increase in the environmental impact of the facility or a substantial change in the location of all or a portion of such a facility"" that requires a new consideration since very little guidance for wind projects on what would trigger new investigation. what will significantly impact the wildlife and people of a county in ways that weren't foreseeable when the project was initially approved or didn't provide sufficient details of the findings.

The article said researchers have found that the climate around a large wind farm in Texas was affected by the presence of the turbines. found a ""significant warming trend"" , This could have long term effects on wildlife living in the immediate areas of larger wind farms. It could also affect regional weather patterns as warmer areas affect the formation of cloud and even wind speeds Satellite data over a large area in Texas, that is now covered by four of the world's largest wind farms, found that over a decade the local temperature went up by almost 1C as more turbines are built.. Taking the ground temperatures measured by satellites, they detected a warming of 0.5C at night in the region directly under the farm. This approach was first attempted by David Keith and colleagues in 2004. When they compared the climate in their model with and without extremely large wind farms (large enough to generate about twice the world's total present electrical demand), they found that in addition to climate effects in the immediate vicinity of the wind farms, there were changes in climate all around the world. Vautard's study agrees with this earlier work, in finding that the climate impacts of wind farms extend beyond the farms themselves and are caused by changes in the flow of the atmosphere that bring warming and cooling to different regions around the wind farms.

I agree with past commenters that animals associated with the Endangered Species Act (ESA) should be excluded from the mitigation revision, or at least the policy revision should not overrule ESA regulations. Those species are conserved under special circumstances and a generalized revision policy focused on ""net conservation gain"" could be detrimental for species with small numbers as higher populated species would show a net gain, but a net loss of diversity could occur. National and State Parks should also continue to be held to their same standards, a revised mitigation policy is important for these areas, but only with the same standards being upheld, as these are some of the few locations those species have with the lowest human impacts. As stated in the article ""Speciation gradients and the distribution of biodiversity"" by Dolph Schluter & Matthew W. Pennell, ""...human impacts might be generating new speciation gradients between environments that are highly affected and those that are more pristine. "" The more pristine environments of the US are our National Parks, so as long as mitigation efforts in those areas are still upheld to the standards, then I agree with this proposed revision.

49,9,"STOP ENVIRONMENTAL ACTVIST from Damaging pipeline infrastructure NOT GOOD FOR WILDLIFE, NOT GOOD FOR AMERICA, U.S. Representative Kristi Noem OCT 23 2017 urged the U.S. Department of Justice to evaluate the security of America's pipeline infrastructure. A Letter Signed by Noem and more than 80 MEMEBERS of CONGRESS, the letter highlights recent attempts to disrupt the transmission of oil and natural gas through pipelines. In some instances, individuals have used blow torches to burn holes in pipelines or promoted violence against oil and gas company employees. Noem is seeking more information from the Department on any policy changes needed to better secure this critical infrastructure. ""When an individual burns a hole through a pipeline currently in operation, there is a high probability this could ignite the contents, killing not only the perpetrator but other innocent victims,"" wrote Noem in the letter. ""We realize the Department of Justice faces unique challenges when confronting these crimes... But maintaining safe and reliable energy infrastructure is a matter of national security.""
LETTER READS ; Multiple media sources have reported recent attempts to disrupt the transmission of oil and natural gas through interstate and international pipeline infrastructure. In some instances, individuals have used blow torches to burn holes in pipelines or promoted violence against oil and gas company employees. In April, a newspaper in Colorado went as far as publishing a letter to the editor that stated, ""If the oil and gas industry puts fracking wells in our neighborhoods, threatening our lives and our children's lives, then don't we have a moral responsibility to blow up wells and eliminate fracking and workers?""
While we are strong advocates for the First Amendment, violence toward individuals and destruction of property are both illegal and potentially fatal.
Damaging pipeline infrastructure poses multiple risks to humans and the environment. When an individual burns a hole through a pipeline currently in operation, there is a high probability this could ignite the contents, killing not only the perpetrator but other innocent victims. It also has the potential to cause property and environmental damage, as well as disrupt services to communities and consumers.
Recent incidents of individuals attempting to shut down lines by turning valves at pump stations illustrate the danger. Operation of pipeline facilities by unqualified personnel could result in a rupture - the consequences of which would be devastating. Even though some activists commit these acts of sabotage to raise awareness about climate change, they only create the serious risk of harm to the environment they claim to care about.
We realize the Department of Justice (DOJ) faces unique challenges when confronting these crimes, including identifying suspects amidst the rural and remote infrastructure across the country. But maintaining safe and reliable energy infrastructure is a matter of national security.
With this information in mind, we request that you respond to the following questions:
1.Do existing federal statutes, including the Patriot Act and Pipeline Safety Act, adequately arm the DOJ to prosecute criminal activity against energy infrastructure at the federal level?
2.Has the DOJ taken any prosecutorial or investigative action against those involved with the highly publicized October 11, 2016, attempted sabotage of four major crude oil pipelines in multiple states? If not, please explain the DOJ's reasoning for not pursuing this case.
3.Does the DOJ intend to pursue federal prosecutorial or investigative action of any individuals who knowingly and willfully damaged or destroyed interstate or international pipeline infrastructure?
4.Do the attacks against the nation's energy infrastructure, which pose a threat to human life, and appear to be intended to intimidate and coerce policy changes, fall within the DOJ's understanding of 18 U.S.C. Section 2331(5)
Unnecessary permitting delays, costly regulatory requirements and uncertainty in the leasing process have discouraged oil and gas development on federal lands. For example, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued Applications for Permits to Drill in an average of 257 days in 2016. By contrast, State agencies issued permits in just 30 days on average.

The ESA, federal implementation of it, and seemingly never-ending litigation are creating increasing impediments towards reaching that goal. Only by removing these impediments can the ESA be improved for the benefit of saving species. Federal agencies that implement ESA should not list species unless and until they are able to identify actual recovery and numerical goals for healthy species populations upfrontbefore, or at the time of any proposed rule involving listing a species. Recovery plans should be drafted and completed and approved before listing or critical habitat is designated, not as an afterthought, years later, or not at all. Rather than basing decisions on vague trends showing decline or improvement or ""professional opinions,"" ESA listing/delisting petitions should not be accepted by federal ESA implementing agencies unless based on actual data relating to species' condition. Data used for listing decisions should be made public, especially if the data and related studies are being financed by the taxpayer. Federal agencies should have discretion to extend 12 month or 90-day deadlines relating to species listing or critical habitat determinations, without fear of spurious litigation. Rather than force federal agencies to accept petition with equal weight no matter how lacking science and data. Agencies should allow to incorporate the best and most current data. Agencies' Listing Priority Guidance (48 Fed. Reg. 43098) should supersede any conflicting 12-month or 90-day deadline set by rule, settlement or other action. Several terms in the law have become magnets for misinterpretation, conflicting interpretations, or even litigation, and should be clarified, including, for example: ""foreseeable future""; ""significant portion of the range,"" ""jeopardy"" to a species, the technological and economic feasibility of ""reasonable and prudent alternatives/measures,"" and ""maximum extent practicable"" relating to mitigation. Federal agencies should be required to disclose all details of consent decrees to Congress and an appropriate NEPA process should be applied for settlements to ensure public input in ESA decisions, and to ensure they include best scientific data. Litigious groups and plaintiffs should be discouraged from filing procedural challenges against agencies simply because they do not agree with the agency's decisions, (such as delisting determinations, findings of species listing not warranted). Litigants should be required to pay their own way to curb repeated litigation and foster court cases only on substantive matters. To discourage forum shopping by frequent ESA-litigation-plaintiffs, ESA lawsuits should not be permitted in federal courts other than in a state a species is primarily located. Hourly fees paid by the federal government to litigious attorneys for ESA litigation should be capped like other federal statutes to prevent lucrative payment of attorneys' fees. non-governmental organizations or individuals that file ESA-related lawsuits against the federal government should be barred from receiving federal taxpayer-funded grants. Since money is fungible, litigation should not be subsidized by taxpayers. Section 6(a) should be strengthened to ensure that states' roles in ESA policy provisions have meaning and are enforceable. To encourage voluntary Habitat Conservation Plans should be exempt from critical habitat designations. Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce should authorize certain circumstances to reevaluate, without judicial review, any critical habitat or listing decision where evidence shows significant economic harm . critical habitat economic analyses should be required at the time of any proposed listing . federal agencies should be required to justify why data relied upon for ESA decision is the ""best available"" and why such data is deemed ""accurate"" and ""reliable."" Data used by federal agencies for ESA decisions should be made publicly available . To ensure accountability, ESA-related peer reviews that do not comply with the Data Quality Act should be deemed ""arbitrary and capricious

I am against repealing the 2016 Mitigation Policy. I want my public lands to be managed with a net gain of conservation outcomes, including the effects of climate change. I do not want my public lands including those adminstered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management to be destroyed by lack of conservation. I want my public lands to remain intact, for my next many generations of my children and the generations of American people.

52,2,"Obama administration agencies added more than $80 billion of regulatory burden on the American economy in just 8 years of his term, hurting the poor in America and based on erroneous reports. 
A 2014 a past EPA person acknowledged that EPA's enforcement philosophy was to ""crucify"" the oil and gas industry. Political motives, it is clear investigations were used to test the limits of the Agency's enforcement authority over the oil and gas industry and was an attempt to defame hydraulic fracturing. Consequently, EPA received significant scrutiny from the state, Congress, numerous stakeholders, and even EPA's own scientists over the justification. an EPA environmental chemist, sent an email to other EPA staff shortly before a EAO was issued saying ""this is not conclusive evidence because of the limited data set...the only way now to compare the data would be to make assumptions to fill in data gaps and I don't believe we have enough experience at this site or data to do this at this time. EPA's ""designated representative"" in a legal deposition, stated that the EPA had not determined a gas and oil company caused or contributed to natural gas in the water, that the EPA had knowledge of naturally occurring methane gas in the local water, and that EPA did ""no geologic investigation"" to substantiate their claims. Similar to EPA's backtrack in another investigation, withdrew the EAO April 2012. Internal communications obtained by the Senate Committee reveal how EPA set aside facts to play politics in a case.
In December 2011, In EPA draft report on groundwater and Hydraulic fracturing the findings were inaccurate and not the result of properly conducted hydraulic fracturing. EPA ignored the scientific process and manipulated its findings, failing to consult with the USGS or even the state before releasing the report. EPA ignored data that documented naturally occurring substances in groundwater, used incomplete data sets, and disregarded USGS sampling recommendations. In fact, EPA breached its internal policy for drilling groundwater monitoring wells. Accordingly, the draft report received numerous criticisms by the state, Congress, and other federal agencies. Even BLM criticized EPA's draft report, writing that the ""data presented thus far seems to be at a scale and resolution insufficient to answer the questions this investigation raises,"" and that ""bias in the samples obtained from these wells may exist. Looking back, it is clear that from the beginning of the investigation, the Obama Administration did not bother to get the science or facts right, nor did they come into Pavillion to make a constructive impact on the long history of drinking water issues for the people. They simply wanted to use the case as an opportunity to publicly ""finger-point"", and link hydraulic fracturing to water contamination, regardless of the facts. After extending the comment period on the draft report three times, the Agency eventually abandoned its investigation in June 2013.
EPA failed approach to link contaminated water to Hydraulic fracturing . First case EPA recanted took place in Dimock, Pennsylvania where environmental activists first made accusations about potential groundwater contamination in December 2011. Despite ongoing state actions, and EPA's agreement with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection that the water in Dimock was safe to drink, EPA soon moved forward under its Superfund authority and sampled 60 private wells in the area. These additional samplings prompted the media to assume there was still a major threat to drinking water from hydraulic fracturing, even though authorities had already deemed it safe. Unfortunately for the Agency and its political agenda, the facts held true and led EPA to both declare the water was safe to drink and confirm state officials' findings that there were no health concerns . The Agency released three rounds of testing that found no contamination and explained the substances found were naturally occurring and common to the area. After the Agency's fourth round of testing found no contamination, EPA ceased its fifth inquiry in July 2012.

53,3,"Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials,

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on portions of your existing Mitigation Policy and Endangered Species Act Compensatory Mitigation Policy (ESA-CMP). In essence, the policies' overall mitigation planning goals must retain ""net conservation gain"" consistent with former President Obama's Memorandum on Mitigating Impacts on Natural Resources From Development and Encouraging Related Private Investment (November 3, 2015). Effective mitigation is a powerful tool for furthering the Service's mission to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats to the continuing benefit of the American people for current and future generations. 

The changes made to these mitigation policies in 2016 were based on numerous growing conservation challenges and practices, including accelerating loss, degradation, and fragmentation of habitats; effects of climate change, human population growth and other new threats; and advances in fish and wildlife conservation science. These challenges and practices remain today and are expected to persist well into the future. Designing mitigation that ensures a ''net conservation gain'' in the status of affected resources is imperative to address the additive impacts that lead to significant deterioration of resources over time, to foster recovery of listed species, and to avoid listing of additional species. This is an obligation of the Service as an administrator of the ESA. Mitigation, as broadly defined in current policy, as ""measures to avoid, minimize, and compensate for impacts"" is an essential means of achieving the overarching purpose of the ESA (to conserve listed species and the ecosystems upon which they depend), and the current mitigation policies provide guidance for doing so most effectively. 

As of the end of 2016, more than 1,500 species listed have been listed under the ESA since its inception. Without a commitment to responsible and implementable standards and polices for accomplishing effective, sustainable mitigation that more than fully offsets the adverse impacts of actions to listed species and other resources of concern, these species and resources are unlikely to recover and persist. Mitigation with a ""net conservation gain"" is necessary because an accurate accounting of the functions and services lost at impact sites and gained at mitigation sites is rarely possible due to the variability and uncertainty inherent in biological systems and ecological processes. Programs and projects should be designed to achieve mitigation beyond no net loss in order to effectively buffer risk, reduce uncertainty, and ensure sufficient conservation benefits for species to promote their recovery. Please retain all of the fundamental principles (a-h) for guiding mitigation as defined in the 2016 policies across all Service programs, especially the goal of ""net conservation gain"". Rescinding this important mitigation policy goal is not necessary to achieve the economic goals of the Secretary of the Interior's Order 3349 on American Energy Independence (March 29, 2017).",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0315,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">quick</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> over the <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span><i></i>"
54,4,"

It is critically important that Fish and Wildlife Service RETAIN net conservation gain as a mitigation planning goal within FWS mitigation policies. The old 1981 Mitigation Policy needed to be strengthened due to accelerating loss of habitats, effects of climate change, and better scientific understanding. Instead of no net loss, the new (current) Mitigation Policy aims to achieve ""a net gain in conservation outcomes."" This is an appropriate planning goal and, as such, must be retained by FWS.

Regulation Needs to be changed ...The Equal Access to Justice Act (""EAJA""), enacted in 1980, allows the award of attorneys' fees in suits by or against the United States in two situations. the ESA has no restriction that attorneys' fees be paid only to prevailing parties, and no limit to the amount of attorneys' fees that can be awarded. In determining attorney fees for ESA cases, the courts use a lodestar approach in setting the rate of fees.
In addition to filing lawsuits, litigious groups have filed increasing numbers of petitions under the ESA, seeking to list species as endangered or threatened under the Act. Under the Act, the FWS or NMFS must make a finding within 90 days of receiving a petition as to whether there is ""substantial information"" indicating whether the petitioned listing may be warranted. After this 90 day finding, there are many statutorily prescribed deadlines and decisions that the agency must make regarding each petition. While the statute may be well-intentioned in formulating a timeline for agency decision making, special interest groups attempting to list hundreds of species at a time was not what was intended and serves only as a vehicle for an award of attorneys' fees, as the deadlines become impossible to meet. endless lawsuits do not serve the purpose of the statute. FWS show the incredibly broken system, with environmental groups filing notices of intent to sue if the government does not make species-specific findings on more than 400 species within a three month time-frame. timeframes provided currently under ESA are not feasible, and that groups are litigating not over whether a species ought to be listed, but that the federal government can't comply with rigid 90-day or 12-month timeframes set by ESA. As a result of FWS' focus on listings, others have complained that opportunities for public comment and engagement, and accessibility to scientific data supporting significant ESA proposals have been short-changed, often with the federal agencies citing deadlines from the mega-settlement as the excuse.
Even efforts by federal agencies to streamline the ESA consultation process for federal fire management plans have been challenged by environmentalists. In 2003, the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, FWS, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and NMFS issued joint regulations that would expedite National Fire Plan actions not likely to adversely impact critical habitat. Activists groups filed suit under ESA, and a federal district court first upheld the regulations, and then reversed itself.
ESA shuts out states, tribes, local governments, and private landowners not only in key ESA decisions but in actual conservation activities to preserve and recover species.

Repeal of Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines Existing Stations Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units Clean Power Plan remains illegal and would do devastating harm to the average American. CPP flawed EPA used a two-step process to set limits on upwind states' emissions. First, EPA determined whether a state's emissions were projected to contribute significantly to air quality problems in a downwind area (making it hard for a downwind area to attain or stay in attainment with ambient air quality standards). Second, EPA determined the amount of emission reductions that in upwind states could make without exceeding a cost threshold. But EPA only used Power Plants, and Not Wildfire air quality problems.
The retrofit-or-retire decision for owners is also impacted by EPA's New Source Review (NSR) regulations that can affect owners' ability to enhance plant efficiency due to the delay, cost, and uncertainty associated with obtaining an NSR permit. The NSR permitting program requires stationary sources of air pollutionincluding factories, industrial boilers, and power plantsto get permits before construction starts, whether the unit is being newly built or modified. This is an important concern for owners considering retrofitting an existing power plant with carbon capture equipment to reduce CO2 emissions, or adding new components to improve operating efficiency. These upgrades could trigger the NSR requirements of the Clean Air Act because they would constitute a ""physical change,"" or lead to a designation of the change as a ""major modification,"" subjecting the unit to NSR permitting requirements. The uncertainty stemming from NSR creates an unnecessary burden that discourages rather than encourages installation of CO2 emission control equipment and investments in efficiency because of the additional expenditures and delays associated with the permitting process.143 144 Ironically, the uncertainty surrounding NSR requirements has led to a significant lack of investment in plant and efficiency upgrades, which would otherwise lead to more efficient power generation, benefits to grid management, and reduced environmental impacts. EPA has acknowledged these burdens and has made attempts to reform the rules to improve and streamline NSR: As applied to existing power plants and refineries, EPA concludes that the NSR program has impeded or resulted in the cancellation of projects which would maintain and improve reliability, efficiency and safety of existing energy capacity. Such discouragement results in lost capacity, as well as lost opportunities to improve energy efficiency and reduce air pollution. A few hydroelectric power plants have not sought relicensing due to concerns over the cost of meeting mandatory environmental requirements imposed by Federal and state resource agencies. Capital upgrade requirements can include capacity uprates (initiated by the plant owner rather than a regulator), dam safety upgrades, or environmental improvements. Agency should cancel all regulations in past few years and start new reports.

Wind Turbines are not efficient. if Billionaires did not push false ideas and tax payer subsides were stopped there would be No Wind Turbines. Not clean but use Toxic material harmful to humans and animals. The wind industry is like the hype such as Dutch tulip mania. elaborate effort to fleece world. Subsidies are what built them. Subsidies are what run them. So, when the subsidies run out, it isn't long before the only remaining force at work is rust. Wind Turbines near water from local aquifers, streams & rivers have the potential for contamination once built.
UNITED KINGDOM has stopped wind Subsidies ; government Treasury said Nov. 22, 2017 there will be NO new low carbon electricity levies before 2025 ( energy subsidies) NO LONGER the right vehicle. GERMANY : electricity rates at close to 30 euro-cents for each kilowatt-hour, they are among the world's highest. By 2021 approx. 5,700 wind turbines will be closed down no wind taxpayer Subsidies. In the following years, 2,000 to 3,000 megawatts each will be decommissioned. That would be more than a quarter wind power capacity which would be eliminated. AUSTRALIA power bills, 20% higher than this time last year. CANADA : Ontario Consumers bills have increase over 88% over the last 5 years due to the wind farm subsidies. Even though after 30 years wind farms only produce 4% of the energy, it cost is 20% of each person bill.. As of 2017, The cost of wind power will add $170 Billion to Taxpayers electrical bills. (To put into perspective, $170 billion can buy 8,500,000 Honda Civics.).

Mortality from factors is substantial on long-term cumulative impacts on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. the economic consequences of losing bats could be substantial. Loss of bats .... could lead to... agricultural losses ...estimated at more than the value of bats to Farmers and Forest , may be as low as... $3.7 billion/year and as high as $53 billion/year....... 
CONCERN : Wind Turbine Noise ... facility that emit a noise level known to exceed health limits, where the noise becomes 'intrusive and annoying' is not only unreasonable, it is unconscionable and should be unlawful. Nuisance noise complaints by neighbors, studies show that turbine noise can lead to sleep deprivation and other health problems also cause Wildlife nesting issues. .

Collisions of small migratory songbird species account for approximately 60% of fatalities at U.S. wind facilities . Small songbirds comprise more than 90% of all landbirds (Partners in Flight Science Committee 2013). Most songbird species are migratory.
CONCERN . magnetic fields can pass through buildings, living things, and most other materials. The electric and magnetic forces in EMFs are caused by electromagnetic radiation. EMFs in the ionizing radiation part of the electromagnetic spectrum can damage DNA or cells directly. study in 1979 pointed to electric power lines and childhood leukemia. nine studies reported a twofold increase in risk of childhood leukemia among children with exposures. case-control study U.S. Air Force personnel found increased risk of brain cancer among personnel who maintained or repaired radiofrequency or microwave-emitting equipment . 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Working Group classified ELF-EMFs as ""possibly carcinogenic ( cancer causing ) to humans,"". 2015, the European Commission Scientific Committee reviewed electromagnetic fields. It found epidemiologic studies of frequency fields show an increased risk of childhood leukemia.

60,10,"Major part of ESA need changing or appealing ASAP... A continuing controversy generated by ESA and related regulations is the conflict between government regulation and private property rights and water rights after a species has been listed. If a property owner has a protected species on their land, the government can limit or ban activities on that land or water source, which may harm the species. Under section 9 of the ESA, individuals are subject to criminal penalties if they ""take"" or ""harm"" a threatened or endangered species.78 The definition of ""harm"" includes any activity that could ""significantly impair essential behavioral patterns, including, breeding, spawning, rearing, migrating, feeding or sheltering"" of a species. the ESA penalizes people for being good stewards of their land. Landowners whose management practices create and preserve habitat for an endangered plant or animal open their land to being regulated under ESA. And contrary to what many environmental pressure groups claim, ESA regulations do not simply prevent development or changes in land use. Customary land uses and practices, such as farming, livestock grazing, and timber production have regularly been prohibited, even when such practices help to maintain the species' habitat."" While the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides that government cannot take private property unless it provides ""just compensation"" to the owner, many private property rights advocates are concerned that courts have not favorably ruled on the onerous effect of ESA regulations that amount to ""regulatory takings"" allowing for just compensation to property owners creates a ""regulatory straightjacket"" and disincentive to landowners, standing in the way of good conservation work, and can actually result in harm to species
 Americans who live near, work on and enjoy our lands, waters and wildlife show a tremendous commitment to conservation that is too often undermined and forgotten by the ESA's litigation-driven model. Species and people should have the right to live and prosper within a 21st century model that recognizes the values of the American people and fosters, not prohibits, a boots on-the-ground conservation philosophy that is working at many state and local levels. While well-intentioned from the beginning, must be updated and modernized to ensure its success where it matters most: outside of the courtroom and on-the-ground. A two percent recovery rate of endangered species is simply not acceptable. ESA can be modernized to more successfully assist species that are truly in danger. It can be updated so species conservation does not create conflicts with people. All the while, the ESA should promote greater transparency in the way our federal government does business. Over 1,500 U.S. domestic species and sub-species have been listed. Many species remain on the list and hundreds more could potentially be added.
Current implementation of ESA is focused too much on responding to listing petitions and unattainable statutory deadlines, litigation threats and ESA regulatory mandates, rather than on defensible policies, science or data to recover and de-list species. This slows or halts a multitude of public and private activities, even those that would protect species. ESA's regulatory requirements work to hinder other much needed efforts to protect the environment, such as control of aquatic invasive species that threaten the Great Lakes and its local water bodies. Current implementation of ESA does not clearly identify what is needed to recover and delist species, resulting in a lack of incentives, for state and private conservation, costly mandates, and wasted resources even in light of increased federal funding. The ESA punishes private property owners and water rights holders and fails to properly account for huge economic and regulatory burdens that also hinder species conservation. The ESA also advances the agendas of groups seeking land and water acquisition and control. The ESA promotes a lack of data transparency and science guiding ESA-related decisions, and there are conflicts of interest and bias in ""peer review"" of federal ESA decisions.
recommends constructive changes in the following categories: Requiring More Transparency and Accountability of ESA Data and Science. Ensuring Greater Transparency and Prioritization of ESA with a Focus on Species Recovery and De-Listing. Reducing ESA Litigation and Encouraging Settlement Reform. Empowering States, Tribes, Local Governments and Private Landowners on ESA Decisions Affecting Them and Their Property.

Most migratory birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act which prohibits the taking, killing, possessing, transporting, and importing of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests, except as authorized under by permit. turbines scattered across the continental U.S., is responsible for about 500,000 bird fatalities each year. The primary federally-listed species affected by operation of wind energy facilities in the Midwest Region is the endangered Indiana bat. Other listed plants and animals, in addition to the Indiana bat may be harmed by the construction of the facilities and infrastructure..... A paper published in Science estimates that bats typically save farmers $74 per acre, and that the value of bats to agriculture in the continental United States is roughly $22.9 billion annually. ... analyses suggesting that loss of bats in North America could lead to agricultural losses estimated at more than $3.7 billion/year. Unprecedented numbers of migratory bats are found dead beneath industrial-scale wind turbines during late summer and autumn in both North America and Europe. ....Bald and Golden Eagles Not all bird species are equally vulnerable to wind turbines. Eagles appear to be particularly susceptible. Large numbers of golden eagles have been killed by wind turbines in the western states. However, bald eagles have also been killed, although not in the numbers seen in the West. Wildlife Concerns Associated with Wind Energy Development . Wind energy developments can harm wildlife and their habitat as a result of: collisions with wind turbines and associated infrastructure (e.g., transmission lines and towers); loss and degradation of habitat from turbines and infrastructure at the project site; fragmentation of large habitat blocks into smaller segments that may not support area-sensitive species. wildlife species that we are most concerned about are species that are declining and under threat from other sources. The magnitude and growth of the wind energy industry is great enough that the resulting mortality and habitat lost could have population-level effects on vulnerable wildlife. large-scale fatalities of bats at wind energy facilities. Much of the emphasis of early wind energy-wildlife research was on bird impacts. However, the results of more recent studies indicate that, generally, far more bats than birds are killed, particularly in the Midwest and Eastern United States. Republican lawmakers in 2014 accused the FWS and DOJ of ignoring wildlife violations by wind farm developers while prosecuting fossil fuel companies for similar infractions. Conservation groups have raised similar concerns about environmental enforcement in the wind industry. Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.

62,2,"Wildfires are the toxic carbon polluters of emissions in air and water, Not oil or gas or Not agriculture, Not Mining, or Not farms, or Not industry, or Not cars. Humans and wildlife need the Local, State, Federal leaders to re think wildfire issues, Fight wildfires before they start; California Environmental activist must allow forest workers to reduce the fuel by cutting old growth and thin the brushes and dead trees. Many forests have had fires of unprecedented intensity and extent, and this situation is the result of forest management practices that have permitted decades of deadwood (fuels) to accumulate. Forests are over grown with dead trees in tinder-dry conditions more susceptible to intense fires. Must shifting fire policies from suppression to recognition that reducing fire fuel is an integral component of the landscape. Wildfire needs to be part of any Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) 2012 act which only cover 28 states but not California, Why ? since the act was to address air pollution from states that send pollution across state lines and affects air quality in other states. Per the CDC web site : Wildfire smoke can harm you in multiple ways. Smoke can irritate your respiratory system, and worsen chronic heart and lung diseases. Wildfire smoke is a mix of gases and fine particles from burning vegetation, building materials, and other materials. Fires can significantly increased toxic co ozone gas , and particulate levels during fire events. Analyses of observations to further probe the magnitude of ozone, ozone precursor, and particulate matter enhancements due to fires. Since the lifetime of CO is long, even the magnitude of the observed enhancement ratios of black carbon and NOy are consistent with loss of less than one-half of the emitted black carbon and nitrogen oxides (i.e., very efficient long-distance transport of the fire emissions. For nitrogen oxides, it implies a potential for large-scale impacts on tropospheric ozone, since most of NOy is believed to be peroxyacetyl nitrate, PAN52,53, which thermally decomposes. 
If we are to protect wildlife and Humans, we must reconsider Wildfire Science has toxic chemical to the Ozone. California Wildfires are the result of decades of fire suppression, coupled with unprecedented fuel buildups due to a lack of forest management activity. Forests in the United States store an estimated 43,126 Tg carbon in live and dead biomass and soil organic matter. These catastrophic fires destroy valuable timber resources but also degrade many of the other uses of healthy forests. Because of the highly flammable nature of the understory vegetation as well as the canopy fuels, forest type represents a major portion of the area burned in a region. Due to the large amount of fuel stored in the organic soils of many forest stand types, forest floor fuel consumption can be very high. 
 Typically the amount of carbon dioxide carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) released from fires can be estimated. By separating carbon pools and combustion type, these fundamental variables are accounted for within the model parameter set. 
The following equations are used. where: A = area burned (hectares, ha) Ca = carbon density of the aboveground component (assumed to be 0.5 of biomass; t ha-1), Cg = carbon density of the organic material found in the ground-layer, which is composed of the litter and duff layers (t ha-1), a and g = proportions of the aboveground vegetation and ground-layer organic carbon, respectively, consumed in the burn, Efg = emission factor for each of three gas species, CO2, CO, and CH4 (in units of gas released per unit of carbon consumed) The analysis using (2) is carried out for each gas independently. The f and s subscripts on the emission factor terms in (2) refer to blazing and smoldering combustion, respectively. The first step in calculating total stand fuel consumption is to determine surface fuel consumption, represented by the sum of fuel consumed in organic soil (or duff), surface litter, dead and downed coarse woody debris (logs), and dead and downed medium woody debris (branches). Each of these stand components has a separate fuel consumption algorithm. Surface fire intensity is calculated by applying the total surface fuel consumption and fire rate of spread to intensity equation. CO is a predictor of other fire emissions products (regression r2 values were: 0.84, 0.98, 0.87 for CH4, NMHC, and PM2.5 respectively). The CH4 regression shows the characteristically high r2 value for these gases that has been observed for most prescribed a wildland fires measured in the contiguous United States. The r2 value of 0.98 indicates that variation in CO concentration highly predicts NMHC concentration.

The FWS mitigation policy for species protection and restoration needs to reemphasize the previously stated goals of at minimum 'no net loss', and when possible goals of 'net gain'. It is also obvious that isolated mitigation efforts lack the long term viability of landscapes with intact forest blocks, elevation changes, unique hydrology and soils and migration corridor connectivity. Overall landscape level mitigation targets and goals can do exponentially more for preservation and recovery of listed species. Programs that allow voluntary payment options for projects requiring mitigation that, in turn, allow for off site funding of a documented landscape level target are highly efficient. Resulting restoration, inventory, initial plans and monitoring requirements are all job makers. The required work and land protection are critical to recovery and removing species from the list.Broad brush removal of some of the best ideas in the mitigation policy should not be lost without an effort to explain the parts of the old policy that need to be retained. Especially common sense partnerships based on a goal of net gain and landscape level focus in recovery efforts.

64,4,"The Water Study was Designed to Fail , Above all of the Administration-wide scientific inquires, the EPA national water study had perhaps the most egregious example of pushing the limits in an effort to needlessly overregulate oil and natural gas development. A manipulation so ridiculous that it defies logic even for this Administration's EPA, and is either evidence of a willful attempt to manipulate data or an impressive lack of understanding of the industry and its practices that EPA so desperately wants to regulate. In 2009, Congress urged EPA to conduct a national study on the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. The legislative text was prescriptive: EPA was to study whether or not a relationship exists between the specific act of hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. However, as should have been expected, the Agency's approach to the study extended far beyond Congressional intent and was used to advance its own agenda. From the time EPA's Office of Research and Development and Office of Water jointly launched the effort, it was clear the Agency intended to use the study as a tool to create a need for increasing federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing regardless of any scientific facts or study outcomes. Despite clear Congressional language, EPA tried to alter the mandated scope of its inquiry to seize any potential opportunity to justify a federal regulatory power grab. Emails obtained by the Committee provide evidence of EPA scheming to push the limits of the study's parameters. In one instance, an email from an EPA official and member of the hydraulic fracturing study steering committee reveals that as of March 11, 2010. After unilaterally expanding the study, EPA ignored warnings by the Science Advisory Board (SAB) that its scope was too broad, inconsistent, and included aspects not directly related to the hydraulic fracturing process. EPA then failed to follow its own quality management plan, which was found to lack detail and guidance for integral elements of the Agency's quality system. Next, EPA released its study plan and hand-picked five sites where there had been previous accusations of groundwater contamination to conduct retrospective case studies. Rather than focus on prospective sites, EPA moved forward with the study plan by collecting data on retrospective sites. Notably, the retrospective sites EPA selected were developed before the study launched in 2010, so the Agency reviewed sites that had been operating with currently outdated technology. almost none of EPA's findings from the retrospective reviews will apply to the majority of currently producing wells or be relevant to current industry practices. the Agency failed to initiate prospective case studies, which would have allowed the Agency to review current practices by testing groundwater before development and monitor it during and after development. As such, the Agency lacks a baseline of information on the groundwater to compare before and after development, a vital component to a complete scientific review. The narrowed analysis makes it extremely difficult to rule out countless other possible sources of contamination, such as naturally occurring substances or other industrial wastes. the study's sample size that EPA selected was extremely small and ""possibly statistically biased."" Among all the oil and natural gas producers, EPA asked only nine to volunteer their participation, omitting a number of the top producing energy exploration and production companies in the U.S. In addition to concerns over EPA's scope, significant gaps existed in EPA's data, and there was no quality assurance in EPA's potential conclusions. Similar to its draft report, EPA was expected to make conclusions over potential impacts, but it has no plans to assess risk or attempt to quantify them. For example, the draft report concluded there were potential hazards associated with the chemicals used in fracturing fluid, but EPA affirmed ""the agency is not conducting a full risk assessment as part of this study,"" which would appropriately clarify the level or likelihood of harm and provide a more honest assessment to the public. Aside from EPA's manipulated approach to the water study, the Agency's final study plan inappropriately expanded the scope of the study likely wasting taxpayer dollars. They expanded the scope to include research projects on the life cycle of water in hydraulic fracturing and environmental justice impacts, which was not part of the purpose of the study. In fact, the House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations had to intervene and direct the Agency to narrow the scope of the study, stating ""No funds have been provided in the bill to research environmental justice impacts related to hydraulic fracturing, and EPA shall discontinue the use of any resources that may have been diverted to this subactivity.""",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0255,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">quick</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span><i></i>"

66,6,"Back to Basics"" concept return Government agencies from its freewheeling past administrative pursuits to its mission according to the explicit decrees of Congress. This view of governing should guide Agencies , rather than efforts that cost to middle class families, the poor, hinder small American business, demonize oil and gas and to end run Congress in the Federal Register or on the courthouse steps. Government solutions should be proportional to the problems they are tasked by congress to solve. Agency should focus on innovative problem solving and partnerships with the states and the private sector that leverage their resources and expertise. Achieving environmental improvements cannot be done in isolation from economic growth. Opportunities for prosperous economic growth and clean air, water, and land are lost without effective infrastructure investments that align with community needs, especially infrastructure investments that repair existing systems, support revitalization of existing communities, take advantage of new ideas that help poor, middle class and puts American people first . Agency plays a role in supporting infrastructure investment by optimizing and aligning its relevant programs to catalyze other resources. Better partner is recognizing that a one-size-fits-all strategy to achieve environmental outcomes has not, and will not, work.

Over the years, outside the regulatory process, well-funded special interest groups have attempted to use lawsuits to force Federal agencies - especially EPA - to issue regulations that advance their priorities. At some point, this exercise of ""Sue-and-Settle"" and the practice of acquiescence through consent decrees or settlement agreements, which were often crafted behind closed doors and without the transparency of the rulemaking process, became all too common. the days of routinely paying tens of thousands of dollars in attorney's fees to these groups with which are swiftly settle. Need a more transparent process in which impacted parties and states have a voice and creates more awareness for the general public. Policies and rules should reflect common sense, consistent with Agency statutory authorities, and the public will benefit from greater regulatory and economic certainty. 
An important aspect of how Agencies must now look at the rule of law is with respect to its own authorities under the law. Reversing an attitude and approach under the previous administration that one can simply reimagine authority under statutes. For far too long, the Agencies pursued initiatives which exceeded the authority granted to it by Congress, or circumvented the will of Congress completely. As an Agency, must ensure regulations are acting within the parameters which Congress has laid out for us. For too long, Agencies has failed to provide the regulatory consistency and certainty the regulated community needs. performing the work that is necessary to meet mission of protecting human health and the environment.

ESA is increasingly becoming a tool for litigation and taxpayer-funded attorneys' fees. The Obama Administration's use of closed-door settlements undermines transparency and involvement of affected stakeholders and drives arbitrary mandates and deadlines that do little to recover species. Many view the ESA as being driven by litigation, or threats of litigation, which in turn distracts from species conservation and recovery. The FWS Director acknowledged that ""when the Service is sued for missing deadlines, we have no defense Publicly available court documents reveal that ESA litigation has risen dramatically over the past few years. In 2012, the Department of Justice (DOJ) provided the House Committee on Natural Resources case information on 613 total cases. Each of these cases was at least partially devoted to litigating some aspect of the ESA. Of these, 573 (93%) were cases where federal agencies were sued under the ESA. That amounts to an average of at least three cases a week dealing just with citizen suits under the ESA. In analyzing the data provided by DOJ, some trends were immediately apparent. Organized and well-funded special interest groups (primarily a few prominent environmental organizations) were significantly more likely to file multiple lawsuits than individual citizens, and much more likely to be awarded attorney's fees. According to the California Forestry Association, environmentalists filed more than 50 appeals in just one county to block thinning projects that sought to protect the Northern Spotted Owl habitat that had been destroyed by fire. In addition, a lawsuit filed by one group led to a federal court order last year that could block state allocation of existing water rights. According to a 2012 GAO Report of cases brought against the Departments of Agriculture (""USDA"") and the Interior between 2000 and 2010, the ESA was the third most expensive and litigious statute for the USDA (costing taxpayers $1.63 million in attorneys' fees and costs), and the most expensive and litigious statute for the entire Interior Department (costing the taxpayers $22 million in attorneys' fees and costs). According to a 2012 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, most federal agencies within the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture do not keep detailed records of the litigation, including the cases where they are required to pay attorneys' fees, or even the type of the cases that involve particular statutes such as the ESA. Because there is no statutory requirement to maintain this information, the House Natural Resources Committee was told that DOJ and other departments do not keep records of these expenditures. DOJ did track some payments to organizations for attorneys' fees and court costs. According to DOJ documents, ESA has cost American taxpayers more than $15 million in attorneys' fees alone - in just the past four years. These groups - and their lawyers - are making millions of taxpayer dollars by suing the federal government, being deemed the ""prevailing party"" by federal courts, and being awarded fees either through settlement with DOJ or by courts. According to the documents provided by DOJ, some attorneys representing nongovernmental entities have been reimbursed at rates as much as $500 per hour, and at least two lawyers have each received over $2 million in attorneys' fees from filing ESA cases.

68,8,"Dear U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials, 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on portions of your existing Mitigation Policy and Endangered Species Act Compensatory Mitigation Policy (ESA-CMP). In essence, the policies' overall mitigation planning goals must retain ""net conservation gain"" consistent with former President Obama's Memorandum on Mitigating Impacts on Natural Resources From Development and Encouraging Related Private Investment (November 3, 2015). Effective mitigation is a powerful tool for furthering the Service's mission to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats to the continuing benefit of the American people for current and future generations. 

The changes made to these mitigation policies in 2016 were based on numerous growing conservation challenges and practices, including accelerating loss, degradation, and fragmentation of habitats; effects of climate change, human population growth and other new threats; and advances in fish and wildlife conservation science. These challenges and practices remain today and are expected to persist well into the future. Designing mitigation that ensures a ''net conservation gain'' in the status of affected resources is imperative to address the additive impacts that lead to significant deterioration of resources over time, to foster recovery of listed species, and to avoid listing of additional species. This is an obligation of the Service as an administrator of the ESA. Mitigation, as broadly defined in current policy, as ""measures to avoid, minimize, and compensate for impacts"" is an essential means of achieving the overarching purpose of the ESA (to conserve listed species and the ecosystems upon which they depend), and the current mitigation policies provide guidance for doing so most effectively. 

As of the end of 2016, more than 1,500 species listed have been listed under the ESA since its inception. Without a commitment to responsible and implementable standards and polices for accomplishing effective, sustainable mitigation that more than fully offsets the adverse impacts of actions to listed species and other resources of concern, these species and resources are unlikely to recover and persist. Mitigation with a ""net conservation gain"" is necessary because an accurate accounting of the functions and services lost at impact sites and gained at mitigation sites is rarely possible due to the variability and uncertainty inherent in biological systems and ecological processes.

69,9,"Wind turbines development Might be against Article 14, Section 4 of the New York State Constitution, which specifically states that the policy of the state is to ""encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural lands for the production of food and other agricultural products [which]...shall include the protection of agricultural lands."". Wind Turbines are a hazard for terrestrial and aquatic habitat for 18 animal species listed as endangered or threatened in New York State that are protected under the State Endangered Species Law and associated regulations. Ecological and economic importance of insectivorous bats in Agriculture. the increased development of wind-power facilities are threatening populations of insectivorous bats Endangered and threatened wildlife may be adversely impacted through project actions such as clearing, grading and road building that occur within the habitats that they occupy. Certain species are unable to avoid direct impact due to their inherent poor mobility (e.g., Blanding's turtle, club shell mussel, and the brook floater and green floater). Bats are voracious predators of nocturnal insects, including many crop and forest pests. Analyses suggesting that loss of bats in North America could lead to agricultural losses estimated at more than $3.7 billion/year. Bats play an incredibly important role in the ecosystem, eating billions of crop-destroying insects like moths and beetles, as well as mosquitoes. But in just four years, more than a million bats have been killed. The Indiana bat is a temperate, insectivorous, migratory bat. In spring, reproductive females migrate and form maternity colonies where they bear and raise their young in wooded areas. Accordingly, significant adverse impacts to ecosystems and wildlife would result. depending upon the level of development, some agricultural land could be lost. adverse impacts to organic agriculture. The potential significant adverse environmental impacts relating to agricultural land must be considered within the framework of the goals . The severity of impacts on community character in rural communities would be greater for those areas where development is focused in a particular location or region. New York State also has special or unique character, have been afforded additional protection to ensure their availability for public use, enjoyment, and provide important wildlife habitat and open space. Surface disturbance associated with wind turbines noise and visual effects could have negative impacts on habitats on state-owned lands, and recreational use of those lands, especially in large contiguous forest patches that are valuable because they sustain wide-ranging forest species and provide important habitat for forest interior species. significant increase of visual, noise, and traffic impacts of wind turbines results in greater significant site-specific and cumulative impacts to constitutionally protected Forest Preserve land, adversely impacting its mandated ""forever wild"" forest land character and preventing the public from having a Forest Preserve experience characterized by peace and quiet as envisioned by those who framed the Forest Preserve's constitutional protection.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0217,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">quick</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> over the <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span><i></i>"

As the USFWS mitigation policy points out, of all the loss of natural habitat in the United States that has ever occurred, 37% of it has happened since 1982. That shows that our current environmental protections are not enough if we want to stop rapidly losing what little natural habitat remains. The requirement for a ""net gain, or at a minimum, no net loss"" in the USFWS ESA compensatory mitigation policy is a step in the right direction and must be retained. In fact, the language should end with 'the goal is a net gain.' No net loss is not good enough to ensure our threatened and endangered species are nudged toward recovery until they can be removed from federal protections; a 'net gain' achieved by each project or impact will accomplish recovery and delisting if accurately applied.

71,1,"Say a loud ""no"" to the out-of-state wind producers who are encouraged by billions in wasteful taxpayer subsidies to destroy Birds, Bats, and our mountains. just take another look at the photograph of what has happened to Palm Springs, California. 
November 14, 2017 U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) today spoke on the Senate floor about tax reform, suggesting Congress should end the wind production tax credit at the end of the year. ""The wind production tax credit has been in place for twenty-five years and has been extended ten different times by Congress. To date, the wind production tax credit has already cost taxpayers billions, and Congress has recognized the need to end the wind production tax credit by passing legislation to phase out the credit by 2020, but we should do better,"" Alexander said. ""We have turned our attention to tax reform and our principle challenge is to find tax breaks and loopholes to eliminate so that we can lower rates for taxpayers - ending the wasteful and expensive subsidy for a clearly mature technology this year."" ""For eight years - from 2008 to 2015 - the wind production tax credit cost taxpayers $9.6 billion - that's more than one billion per year. According to the Congressional Research Service, the wind production tax credit is expected to cost taxpayers over $23 billion from 2016 to 2020. ""Despite the billions Congress has provided in subsidies, wind energy still only produces 6 percent of our country's electricity and 17 percent of our country's carbon-free electricity - and the wind only blows 35 percent of the time. On average, wind turbines are over two times as tall as the skyboxes at Neyland Stadium and taller than the Statue of Liberty. And the blades on windmills can be as long as a football field and their blinking lights can be seen for twenty miles.""
I also believe the conversation about energy subsidies and taxes is bigger than the wind production tax credit. ""As Congress examines ways to reduce tax rates and broaden the base, we must be willing to look at all tax subsidies for mature technologies. I'm here today to challenge my colleagues to be willing to consider all energy subsidies for mature technologies - wind, solar, oil and gas - as candidates for elimination in a tax reform bill. These dollars could be better spent to lower rates for taxpayers.""In 1867, when the naturalist John Muir first walked into the Cumberland Mountains, he wrote, ""The scenery is far grander than any I ever before beheld. ...Such an ocean of wooded, waving, swelling mountain beauty and grandeur is not to be described.""Wind turbines destroy America's natural beauty.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0171,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jump</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span><i></i>"

Proposed Icebreaker Wind Energy Project Is bad for Migratory Birds and endangered Indiana bat in area ; FW Service estimates that WIND TURBINES may kill a half a million birds a year. Most migratory birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act which prohibits the taking, killing, possessing, transporting, and importing of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests, except as authorized under by permit. turbines scattered across the continental U.S., is responsible for about 500,000 bird fatalities each year. The primary federally-listed species affected by operation of wind energy facilities in the Midwest Region is the endangered Indiana bat. Other listed plants and animals, in addition to the Indiana bat may be harmed by the construction of the facilities and infrastructure 
BAD FOR FARMERS....A paper published in Science estimates that bats typically SAVE FARMERS $74 per acre, and that the value of bats to agriculture in the continental United States is roughly $22.9 billion annually. ... analyses suggesting that LOSS OF BATS in North America could lead to AGRICULTURAL LOSSES estimated at more than $3.7 BILLION/year. Unprecedented numbers of migratory bats are found dead beneath industrial-scale wind turbines 
Numerous Inadequacies Found in Environmental Assessment of wind farms.
Wildlife group having conducted more than 30 years of migratory bird research along Lake Erie, the six-turbine Icebreaker project would pose a significant threat to wildlife and substantially increased impacts that would be triggered by the planned expansion of the project to more than 1,000 turbines."" Organizations highlighted five major concerns which were submitted to the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy: 1.The proposed Icebreaker project site is approximately seven miles from the Lake Erie shoreline, near Cleveland, Ohio. Five recent advanced radar studies conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have recorded vast numbers of migratory birds and bats within 5 to 10 miles of the Great Lakes shorelines, including Lake Erie. Many were flying within the rotor-swept area of wind turbines. Globally Important Bird Area (IBA): The Ohio waters of the Central Basin of Lake Erie registered with BirdLife International and the National Audubon Society as globally significant habitat for birds this should automatic trigger detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), instead of a cursory EA. 2.assessment cites outdated studies and ignores new data. These data show that the species uses the airspace of central Lake Erie almost exclusively for its fall migration. The site selected for the Icebreaker project turbines could put the entire world population of this rare species at risk. 3.To reach the little to no impact conclusion, the industry assessors relied on limited visual surveys conducted only during daytime and in good weather to conclude that migrating birds fly at a height of turbines' blades.songbirds and most bats migrate at night. The risk from wind energy facilities is greater , heavy rain, fog, or low cloud cover, which can affect flight altitude and bring them within the rotor-swept area of the turbines. 4.The assessment erroneously concludes that migratory birds and bats avoid crossing Lake Erie, instead flying around it. ""Anyone watching birds on the shore of Lake Erie can see that birds do in fact fly over the water. Studies also large numbers of migratory birds and bats cross the lake, many of them making the long journey after stopping at the shoreline to rest and feed."" 5.The EA fails to acknowledge similar existing or planned projects throughout the Great Lakes that could increase the cumulative impacts on birds and bats an evaluation required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). What happens with the Icebreaker project could set an important precedent for the Great Lakes region on both sides of the border. Ontario, for instance, has placed a moratorium on any open water wind facilities in Lake Erie until Icebreaker is decided. hope that these concerns will be reflected in any future assessments of the environmental impact of Icebreaker and other proposed offshore wind energy development in the Great Lakes. A public comment period closed earlier this month, and a final EA could be issued in the next few months. ""Environmental assessments are intended to evaluate risks to public trust resources like wildlife before projects move forward,"" no more based on inadequate studies that contradict easily observable facts and ignore up-to-date science and cumulative impacts. we need to do much better to minimize impacts to birds and other wildlife."" ...

73,3,"If managed wisely, and remove the environmental activists , America's national forests can provide clean water, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and abundant domestic supplies of wood products and support rural communities and thousands of jobs in the timber industry. Unfortunately, this year's wildfire season like recent past wildfire seasons, produced several catastrophic fires that have destroyed more than 9 million acres, resulting in the tragic loss of life and property. In many cases, however, it's possible to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire through proactive, healthy forest management. While factors such as prolonged drought continue to raise the risk of wildfire, it is imperative that the federal government actively address the one issue within its control: hazardous fuels. Unnatural, overgrown, and unhealthy forests increase the risk and intensity of wildfires. Active management; e.g., thinning the forests, helps protect and restore forests while also helping local economies, and creating jobs. The inability of the Forest Service to thin forests due to overly cumbersome and lengthy environmental processes, increasing frivolous lawsuits filed by certain litigious environmental groups, and a lack of sufficient agency focus on this challenge has led to nearly 60 million acres that are at high risk of deadly and catastrophic forest fires that endanger communities, hurt local economies, destroy land and water quality and release massive amounts of emissions into the atmosphere. the causes of catastrophic wildfire are complex, the status quo of inaction has exacerbated present forest conditions, which now present a great risk to both communities and the environment. Congress should require the costs and benefits of a proposed forest project be weighed against the costs and benefits of doing nothing to address wildfire threats, disease and insect infestation, and their impacts on local water supply, air quality and wildlife habitat. The choice not to manage the forest is a management decision that directly impacts public health. Additionally, the USFS should expedite regulatory analyses for timber salvage after major wildfires and other natural disasters. This will provide the USFS with some of the revenue it needs to execute critical and time-sensitive post-fire reforestation work. improving forest health and reducing wildfire risk, increased active management will generate more revenue for the federal treasury and the critical services provided by counties, and promote job creation and economic growth in counties across the nation. a market-driven approach to forest management projects can work to achieve both forest management goals and increased forest production. The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) must be reformed to ensure litigants are not able to exploit the law, and avoid legal caps on attorney's fees. EAJA's original intention was to compensate small business and individuals who do not have the financial means to challenge federal actions in court. While individuals with a net worth greater than $2 million and organizations with a net worth above $7 million are not eligible for reimbursement of legal fees, non-profit organizations are not subject to these limitations. Additionally, some litigants suing to stop land management projects have successfully argued their expertise is specialized, and therefore not subject to the cap.

74,4,"What happening there is a smaller loud group of anti-human so-called environmentalists that opposed Gas and clean coal, mining, precisely because it allowed for so much cheap and abundant power, they say, if we're going to stop the human cancer, we have to cut off its energy supplies. They turned out to be wrong about that too, because if you really want to reduce humankind's negative impact, then we need to live in cities. We use more energy in cities, we need more energy for our agriculture, for growing food, and it turns out that actually energy consumption is correlated very strongly with environmental protection. We just need a lot of energy to protect the natural world. You have to remember that there were genuine conservationists in the 1960s
The sometimes-tenuous nature of the mineral supply chain received world attention in 2010 when China suddenly drastically cut its export quota for the rare-earth elements. The move highlighted the fact that China had a virtual monopoly on the short-term supply of rare-earth elementselements that are essential to the renewable energy sector and many other high-tech applications globally. The rest of the world was left scrambling to find alternative and secure supplies. China is also the world's major producer of a number of other mineral commodities that are essential in high-tech applications, renewable energy, and national security, including antimony, bismuth, fluorspar, germanium, graphite, and indium (Price, 2013). These and other mineral commodities that are largely controlled by one country, such as cobalt (Democratic Republic of the Congo), niobium (Brazil), and platinum (South Africa), are also considered to be at high risk of supply disruption and would have high impact if supply restrictions should take place
The United States was the world's leading producer of copper for much of the 20th century, but Chile became the leading copper-producing country in 1982 and has remained so. In 2014, China accounted for 20 percent or more of the world's mine production of more than 40 mineral commodities; these included the rare-earth elements, of which China accounted for 85 percent of world production; tungsten, 82 percent; antimony, 76 percent; germanium, 73 percent; mercury, 68 percent; graphite, 66 percent; fluorspar, 59 percent; and bismuth, 56 percent (U.S. Geological Survey, 2016).
United States mineral production has greatly increased but has not kept pace with consumption. Self-sufficiency in minerals has declined, both overall and in numbers of minerals involved.
The commodities or commodity groups included are antimony, barite, beryllium, cobalt, fluorine, gallium, germanium, graphite, hafnium, indium, lithium, manganese, niobium, platinum-group elements, rare-earth elements, rhenium, selenium, tantalum, tellurium, tin, titanium, vanadium, and zirconium. All these commodities have been listed as critical and (or) strategic in one or more of the recent studies based on assessed likelihood of supply interruption and the possible cost of such a disruption to the assessor. For some of the minerals, current production is limited to only one or a few countries.
The economy and the national security of the United States are based directly or indirectly on minerals and, in the early 1970s, there was increasing recognition of and concern about the fact that the United States did not have adequate domestic supplies of many of the nonfuel minerals needed to sustain its economy

an increasing awareness and sensitivity to potential environmental and health issues caused by the mining and processing of many mineral commodities may place additional restrictions on mineral supplies. These factors have led a number of Governments, including the Government of the United States, to attempt to identify those mineral commodities that are viewed as most ""critical"" to the national economy and (or) security if supplies should be curtailed. The lists of critical minerals compiled by Governments and other organizations vary in the number and individual rankings of mineral commodities included on them, but many of the lists include several of the same commodities.

75,5,"Quintessential Cases of Bureaucratic Abuse Over several Obama year. Based on flawed science and assumptions, falsified evidence EPA had repeatedly abused its power in premeditated and concerted attacks on hydraulic fracturing as highlighted in three specific cases: Dimock, Pennsylvania, Pavillion, Wyoming, and Parker County, Texas. While there was no confirmed cases of groundwater contamination resulting from hydraulic fracturing throughout over one million fractured wells, EPA used these three instances to attempt to publicly besmirch the practice and to appease far-left environmentalists while swaying public opinion towards baseless and overzealous claims. In each case EPA circumvented the states, made unfounded claims directly attempting to implicate hydraulic fracturing, and then backpedaled and withdrew from the investigations. Although EPA eventually abandoned all these cases, they were an effective tool for the Agency to shift public perception of hydraulic fracturing and set the stage for future opportunities to attack the process.
UAE stood to lose billions in lost oil revenues as the U.S. oil and natural gas boom continues. By Working hand in Hand with Hollywood stars and Environmental activist was one way to unsure money flowed to their nation not America People. One of 2014 illustrations of involved two film producers ( Hollywood anti-fracking activists' hypocritical) , eager to accept Middle Eastern oil money to create an American anti-fracking film. Hollywood propaganda in the anti-fracking movement, In May 2014, a video was released demonstrating an undercover investigator portraying himself as a wealthy Middle Eastern investor and makes clear he wants to ban hydraulic fracturing in American because it hurts the Middle Eastern oil industry. The Hollywood producers not only agree to make the movie, but they also express no qualms with hiding his financial support behind a wall of far-left environmental activists and other non-profit organizations. One producer explained it is necessary to hide his investment so that the film will have greater credibility and political impact. People recognize the misinformation in Hollywood films. According to a report of one survey, one of the controversial films ranked dead last in terms of trustworthiness and as a source of information on shale gas extraction in the Marcellus. While publicly admitted knowledge of these findings and chose to leave them out because he considered them 'not relevant', funding for documentaries may explain his baseless anti-fracking illustrations. The New York-based and member of the Billionaire's Club Foundation was listed as the only ""Key Funder"". Activism extends beyond documentaries making claims without supporting information. While Hollywood actors-turned-activists enjoy disinformation , these individuals are far removed from the everyday economic and energy needs of the American people. For example, one actor used the yacht of deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE)a country that makes billions each year due to the export of fossil fuels during the 2014 World Cup and previously hosted a party on the yacht with other Hollywood stars. Experts estimate the yacht emits more than 2,700 tons of carbon dioxide per tank with an estimated fuel economy of one mile per gallon. Another example of Hollywood anti-fracking hypocrisy a member of Against Fracking wrote and directed the anti-fracking film, which was financed by the UAE. 
One should ponder how Hollywood would make money if it was not for film equipment, televisions, DVD's and DVD players made of fossil fuels, if people could not drive to a movie theater in an automobile that is made from and runs on fossil fuels, and if actors and crew could not fly to filming locations all around the world in planes and helicopters that are made from and run on fossil fuels. Anti-fracking activists may have social media, fame, and wealth on their side, but they do not have the facts. While activists' motives for promoting such misinformation into the public sphere are hypocritical, it is critical for the public to understand that the vast majority of assertions are easily and extensively refuted.
 Improper Scientific Approach to Reach Preconceived Conclusions While EPA aggressively moved forward with its attack on the oil and gas industry, it routinely lacked the necessary scientific foundation to justify its actions.

Scientists Claim Computer Model Predictions are 'Useless Arithmetic' - a coastal geologist and emeritus professor The coastal models are so flawed that Geologist recommends dredging up a lot of sand and dumping it on the beach ""willy-nilly"" and he predicts you would end up with the same result, minus the ""false mathematical certitude. Nuclear physicist, a PhD-trained scientist and a former researcher for Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Organization (CSIRO) and the Defense Science and Technology Organization (DSTO), questioned man-made climate fears in 2007. ""It has been found that warming is occurring on Pluto, Mars, Jupiter and Triton,"" ""The last time I looked, there were NO EVIL GREENHOUSE GAS belching industries on those planets, subplanets and moons,"" which clearly indicated that increased solar activity was a significant factor,"" studies of ice core data reveals that warming precedes rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere.

Statistician study which found that the solar system regulates the earth's climate. The processes by which the sun affects the earth show periodicities on many time scales; each process is stochastic and immensely complex.

A policy of emission reductions is like taking out an 'insurance policy' in which there is never any positive payoff, Research physicist, paper questioning carbon dioxide measurements in the atmosphere titled ""Everyone is Entitled to Their Own Opinion But Not Their Own Facts."" paper found that ""it is NOT POSSIBLE to compare peaks and valleys in CO2 measurements from VOSTOK or EPICA with contemporary atmospheric time series. There is a mismatch in gas age resolutions. Peaks are flattened and valleys are fill of rice core measurements."" The paper concluded, ""Thus on our contemporary timescale it is not possible to say that CO2 level has not been above 300 ppm for the last 500,000 years. The same comment applies to comparing the 'rapid' run up of contemporary CO2 levels with the ice core records where 'sharp' pulses of less than 100 years may well be smoothed away.""

""Let us start with a simple question: 'Is the world warming?' The surface temperature records used by the IPCC show that it has warmed by 0.7 deg C since 1900. The world has not warmed since 1998 and temperatures have been steady since 2002. Leyland also disputed any link between man-made CO2 and temperature.

81,1,"2018 Promote America oil and gas and LNG exports, and coal and mining, and Timber sales, and farming and not choose radical environmentalists over the American people. Those most hurt by Obama agencies rules and regulations were the millions of Poor and Middle class Americans who need these jobs the most. National environmental groups, that only a few years prior to Obama EPA , praised natural gas as the bridge fuel to a clean environment, but last 8 years changed to oppose . Special interest groups have largely chosen their sides between the political parties and refuse to work within reasonable bounds. Instead, they seemed to happily, if not blindly, balance on the edge of a partisan cliff while U.S. competitiveness tumbles down it. The issue of providing energy to the nation while maintaining a clean environment has become overly politicized where spin and rhetoric are preferred over facts and science. Congress should consider steering the U.S. out of the natural gas crisis and back toward a competitive and vibrant economy. It is critical that Congress act to keep American resource production from snowballing into economy-wide destruction and repeal the burdens of regulations.
Power generators expanded their demand for natural gas by 36% over the period 1997-2000. The Energy Information Administration found that between 2000 and 2003, 93 percent (187 gigawatts) of new generation capacity was gas-fired. In a June 2005 report the State of California consumed approximately 6 to 10 billion feet of natural gas per day. If California were a country, it would have ranked as the tenth largest user of natural gas worldwide. Natural gas is regarded as the cleanest burning fossil fuel and therefore should be preferred over other sources, so why is it not championed by environmental groups? Instead , they had significant and detrimental impacts on the U.S. gas and oil economy as a whole, and consumers and workers specifically. In 2018 time to say No to so call Environmentalist activist and bad science that benefit the elite. 
In an industrialized and globally competitive world, energy use represents a very real and fixed cost of doing business and more fundamentally, of life. Consumers and businesses have moderated and may continue to moderate their energy use marginally, but in the end, they require energy for survival. More simply, energy is not a luxury; it is a necessity.
The Congressional Joint Economic Committee found that, ""environmental laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s, and their subsequent regulations, encouraged utilities to use clean burning natural gas. during this time 90 percent of new power plants were gas-fired in large part as a result of government environmental policies. Some states' percentage of natural gas-dependent electricity was closer to 100 percent, and many of those states were starving for more natural gas. For example all of California's power plants from 1998-2005 had been natural gas-fired facilities. The U.S. have abundant natural gas resources with trillions of cubic feet, and finding more by the month. America is not running out of natural gas, and it is not running out of places to look for natural gas. America is running out of places where companies were allowed to look for gas. California's Energy Commission in 2005 report concluded that natural gas has allowed power plant developers ""to meet local air quality regulations that implement the federal Clean Air Act."" then the Environmental activist turned against this clean energy, makes no since.
Natural gas has been regarded as the ideal fossil fuel for multiple uses- from electricity generation to manufacturing, in part because of its efficiency, in part because of its relative cleanliness, and in part because of its relatively low delivered cost. For many years, natural gas was a wise and easy choice; America is blessed with an abundant supply and gas burns cleaner and is considered by some to be more environmentally preferable to other fuels. That abundant supply translated to low prices, and those low prices helped fuel a strong and vibrant economy. Most people probably do not realize the importance that natural gas plays in their daily lives. Natural gas is a principal feedstock to several industries including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, the pulp and paper, steel, and fertilizer industries. The most dramatic finding was that U.S. federal laws and policies in Obama administration with regulatory burden had contributed in large measure to the nation's natural gas crisis. Federal environmental policies have prevented a sufficient and corresponding increase in supply of natural gas. These conflicting federal policies have created an artificial barrier for the market.

This could have long term effects on wildlife living in the immediate areas of larger wind farms. It could also affect regional weather patterns as warmer areas affect the formation of cloud and even wind speeds Satellite data over a large area in Texas, that is now covered by four of the world's largest wind farms, found that over a decade the local temperature went up by almost 1C as more turbines are built.. Taking the ground temperatures measured by satellites, they detected a warming of 0.5C at night in the region directly under the farm. New report was also first attempted by David Keith and colleagues back in 2004 but was ignored by leaders. 

When they compared the climate in their model with and without extremely large wind farms (large enough to generate about twice the world's total present electrical demand), they found that in addition to climate effects in the immediate vicinity of the wind farms, there were changes in climate all around the world. Vautard's study agrees with this earlier work, in finding that the climate impacts of wind farms extend beyond the farms themselves and are caused by changes in the flow of the atmosphere that bring warming and cooling to different regions around the wind farms.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0196,"<span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span><i></i>"

84,4,"Over 100,000 bats are being killed by wind turbines each year. Bats have Great Value to Farmers, a single colony of 150 big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in Indiana has been estimated to eat nearly 1.3 million pest insects each year, possibly contributing to the disruption of population cycles of agricultural pests . Other estimates suggest that a single little brown bat can consume 4 to 8 g of insects each night during the active season. published estimates of the value of pest suppression services provided by bats ranges from about $12 to $173/acre (with a most likely scenario of $74/acre) in a cotton-dominated agricultural landscape in south-central Texas. The value of bats to the agriculture industry is estimated nearly $23 billion per year, but may range from $3.7 billion to $53 billion a year. Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) form enormous summer breeding colonies, mostly in caves and under bridges, in south-central Texas and northern Mexico. Their prey includes several species of adult insects whose larvae are known to be important agricultural pests, including the corn earworm or cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa zea). We estimate the bats' value as pest control for cotton production in an eight-county region in south-central Texas.

87,7,"This comment references Sections 4.1.2.1, 4.1.2.2, and 4.1.2.3 of the Endangered Species Act Compensatory Mitigation Policy issued December 27, 2016.

These comments support the idea of 1) modifying the ""mitigation sequence"" (i.e., avoid, then minimize, then compensate) to allow compensatory mitigation to be considered earlier in the sequence when conditions warrant, and 2) including compensatory mitigation as reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) in the consideration of jeopardy and adverse modification determinations. 

There are many situations where avoiding and minimizing a proposed impact is unsustainable due to factors that cannot be controlled by the applicant or the regulatory agencies. The impacted site may be a remnant of past conditions or on an irreversible trend toward adverse change. Even permanent protection of the site may not produce beneficial results because of these adverse conditions or trends.

The concept of avoiding and minimizing impacts before considering compensatory mitigation is valid in a stable landscape where the impacts are relatively infrequent. In rapidly changing landscapes from urbanization, invasive species effects, intense resource extraction, intense agriculture, or climate change, however, it would be prudent to mentally project what the future landscape will offer the resource under consideration and then consider whether the resource is likely to be sustained if the impacts are avoided and minimized. There are many situations where advance mitigation under a strict regulatory framework, such as conservation or mitigation banking, will provide a higher probability of future sustainability than would avoidance and minimization.

These comments support the current language in the sections cited above and are intended to encourage the Service to fully implement a broader view of the mitigation sequence in light of likely future landscape scenarios, especially where conservation and mitigation banks have been established which offer a higher probability of sustaining the resource.",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0276,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jump</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span><i></i>"

Wind Turbines are toxic not clean, Facing a potential ecological Nightmare. Every turbine destroys 3 acres of land; roughly 21,000 acres of FARM LAND lost forever. Wind Turbines near water from local aquifers, streams & rivers have the potential for contamination once built. Wind farm is not ""Green Energy"". The turbine rotors require an excessive amount of oil to turn...as they turn they cause vibrations allowing the oil to move down the turbine into the soil. Wind Turbines to be dismantled at the end of their life cycle estimated that a turbine, depending on size, will cost $400,000 to $1,000,000 to dismantle. Plans as to where to dispose these materials end of 10-20 years, faced with a landscape of old, rusted out, broken down turbines., who is responsible for the costs of building the landfill sites or depots? Wind turbines are highly toxic to the environment when the life of the turbine ends and remains abandoned will be egosystem strain. Each turbine constructed requires at least a couple THOUSAND pounds of Rare Earth Elements (REEs; China still produces 86 percent of the world's supply of Rare Earth Elements in 2014 and close to 60 percent of American supply was imported. Note: Per UNICEF mining cobalt material 40,000 children worked in mines in Africa, material purchased by china, battery then made in Korea, ..... The mineral security of our nation directly affects everything in Americas economic competitiveness. Each turbine construction consists of 800 tons of cement for support, approximately 250 tons of unrecyclable materials, 700 liters of hydraulic fuel and, 600 kilograms of Rare earth elements Multiply 600 kilograms of Rare earth elements by number of Windfarms in America, There is no data on the effects of a 650 feet turbines placed inland; the new turbines are bigger, louder and more powerful that any turbines placed inland to date.
Nuclear, hydro, & gas is clean, cheap and has a 100% reliability, but wind (with 20-30% reliability) is given priority . When produced, wind power has to be used immediately; there's no technology to store it for a later time. There is excess power almost every hour of every day, owns must scrambles to find a users. Because wind power is so unpredictable, wind and solar power initiatives were decided and implemented in such haste that ""no comprehensive business-case evaluation was done to objectively evaluate the impacts of the billion-dollar commitment, example 
Nuclear power costs 6.8 cents per kwh, period. Wind power costs 11-13.5 cents per kwh, plus all other costs . Nuclear can provide approximately 12,947 mwh 24/7 but sadly wind project has the potential of providing 16%-30% of time , 
Placing turbines on a mountain top or natural forest surrounding the cleared land puts yet area in jeopardy from fire. Wind turbines catch fire! Highly flammable materials such as hydraulic oil and plastics are in close proximity to machinery and electrical wires. They ignite a fire when they overheat or are faulty. An immeasurable amount of oxygen, in the form of wind, can quickly fan a fire inside a turbine. Lightning strikes: The simple fact is, a metal structure many stories high on a mountain or rural area with frequent lightning storms is going to get hit and catch fire. Once ignited, the chances of fighting any blaze is diminished due to: 1. the massive height of the wind turbine 2 the remote area proposed 3, The closest fire department is generally miles away, rural communities are comprised of volunteers . In 2014 the College London, the University of Edinburgh and SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden carried out a global assessment of the world's wind farms. Fire has accounted for 10 to 30 per cent of reported turbine accidents.Wind Turbine projects literally steamrolling the objections of a growing chorus of resistance. With substantial subsidies from Washington D.C. building this wind farm in an area with a poor wind rating profits only go to Billionaire.

Bald eagle was chosen as the central image of the Great Seal of the United States on June 20, 1782, by the Founding Fathers at the Congress of the Confederation; BALD EAGLE is widely known as LIVING NATIONAL SYMBOL of the United States and for MANY GENERATIONS has represented values, such as (1) freedom; (2) democracy; (3) courage; (4) strength; (5) spirit; (6) independence; (7) justice; and (8) excellence Whereas the BALD EAGLE is unique to North America and CANNOT BE FOUND naturally in any other part of the world, which was one of primary reasons Founding Fathers selected BALD EAGLE to symbolize the Government of the United States; Bald eagle is central image used in official logos of many branches and departments of Federal Government, including (1) Executive Office of the President; (2) Congress;(3) Supreme Court of the United States;(4) Department of Defense; (5) Department of the Treasury (6) Department of Justice (7) Department of State;(8) Department of Commerce (9) Department of Homeland Security; (10) Department of Veterans Affairs;(11) Department of Labor; (12) Department of Health and Human Services;(13) Department of Energy; (14) Department of Housing and Urban Development; (15) Central Intelligence Agency; and (16) USA Postal Service. Bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of spirit of freedom and sovereignty of the USA; Image and symbolism of bald eagle has: (1) played a significant role in art, music, literature, architecture, commerce, education, and culture in US; and (2) appeared on US stamps, currency, and coinage. Bald eagle was endangered and facing possible extinction in lower 48 States but has made a gradual and encouraging comeback. Dramatic recovery of national bird of the United States is an endangered species success story and an inspirational example to other environmental, natural resource, and wildlife conservation efforts worldwide; 1940 noting that bald eagle was threatened with extinction, Congress passed the Act of June 8, 1940 (commonly known as the ``Bald Eagle Protection Act'') (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), which prohibited killing, selling, or possessing the species, and a 1962 amendment expanded protection to the golden eagle; Whereas, by 1963, there were only estimated 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles remaining in the lower 48 States, with loss of habitat, poaching, pesticides and other environmental contaminants contributing to near demise of national bird of USA. 1967 the bald eagle was officially declared endangered species under Public Law 89-669 (80 Stat. 926) (commonly known as the ``Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966'') in areas in US south of the 40th parallel due to dramatic decline in the population of bald eagle in lower 48 States. Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) was enacted in 1973, and in 1978, the bald eagle was listed as an endangered species throughout the lower 48 States, except in States of Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin, in which bald eagle was listed as a threatened species; In July 1995, US Fish and Wildlife announced lower 48 States, bald eagle had recovered sufficiently to change status of species from endangered to THREATENED;. by 2007, bald eagles residing in lower 48 States to approx. 11,000 pairs. On June 28, 2007, Secretary the Interior and Fish and Wildlife Service removed the bald eagle from protection under Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), but bald eagle continues to be protected under Act of June 8, 1940 (commonly known as the ``Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act'') (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.), section 42 of title 18, United States Code (commonly known as the ``Lacey Act''), and the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3371 et seq.); Whereas Challenger, the trained, bald eagle of American Eagle Foundation, Tenn.

94,4,"The Department of Energy's Golden Field Office works to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy projects by
providing funding opportunities to grant recipients. Occasionally the grant recipients have projects that involve ESA
consultation. The ability to go through an established, predictable, and timely consultation ESA consultation process is vital
to moving the recipient's projects forward. This Draft Policy can contribute to the success of these projects.

Several elements of the Draft Policy are of concern and adjustment to these areas could help to improve the Draft Policy's 
effectiveness:

1. The inclusion of the at-risk species can be problematic. These species often do not have any formal ESA component.
At-risk species can be added to the FWS lists without scientific support, can be added or eliminated without Federal Register
notice, and do not have any regulatory protection requirements. In addition, the concept of at-risk species is not included in 
the other agencies' regulations and policies. This policy should focus on species that have formal protection. Reference to 
at-risk species should be removed from the Draft Policy.
2. The Draft Policy does not include any de minimus size consideration. While consultation considers the extent of potential
impacts to ESA species, the Draft Policy does not. It talks in general terms about credit valuation and ratios, but at some 
point, there should be a consideration as to de minimus project size that this Draft Policy would not apply to. 
3. The Draft Policy states that ""The Service's authority to require mitigation is limited, and our authority to require a
''net gain'' in the status of listed or at-risk species has little or no application under the ESA"". As also noted, the FWS can
still make mitigation recommendations, however, making the appropriate changes to existing regulations to regulate
mitigation would be of far more use.

95,5,"Today the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is failing to achieve its primary purpose of species recovery and instead has become a tool for litigation that drains resources away from real recovery efforts on the state, tribal and local level and blocks job-creating economic activities. original goal was to preserve and recover key domestic species from the brink of extinction. Recommends constructive changes in the following categories: 1. Ensuring Greater Transparency and Prioritization of ESA with a Focus on Species Recovery and De-Listing 2. Reducing ESA Litigation and Encouraging Settlement Reform . 3 Empowering States, Tribes, Local Governments and Private Landowners on ESA Decisions Affecting Them and Their Property. 4 Requiring More Transparency and Accountability of ESA Data and Science. The ESA, federal implementation of it, and seemingly never-ending litigation are creating increasing impediments towards reaching that goal. Only by removing these impediments can the ESA be improved for the benefit of saving species. Federal agencies that implement ESA should not list species unless and until they are able to identify actual recovery and numerical goals for healthy species populations upfrontbefore, or at the time of any proposed rule involving listing a species. Recovery plans should be drafted and completed and approved before listing or critical habitat is designated, not as an afterthought, years later, or not at all. Rather than basing decisions on vague trends showing decline or improvement or ""professional opinions,"" ESA listing/delisting petitions should not be accepted by federal ESA implementing agencies unless based on actual data relating to species' condition. Data used for listing decisions should be made public, especially if the data and related studies are being financed by the taxpayer. Federal agencies should have discretion to extend 12 month or 90-day deadlines relating to species listing or critical habitat determinations, without fear of spurious litigation. Rather than force federal agencies to accept petition with equal weight no matter how lacking science and data. Agencies should allow to incorporate the best and most current data. Agencies' Listing Priority Guidance (48 Fed. Reg. 43098) should supersede any conflicting 12-month or 90-day deadline set by rule, settlement or other action. Several terms in the law have become magnets for misinterpretation, conflicting interpretations, or even litigation, and should be clarified, including, for example: ""foreseeable future""; ""significant portion of the range,"" ""jeopardy"" to a species, the technological and economic feasibility of ""reasonable and prudent alternatives/measures,"" and ""maximum extent practicable"" relating to mitigation. Federal agencies should be required to disclose all details of consent decrees to Congress and an appropriate NEPA process should be applied for settlements to ensure public input in ESA decisions, and to ensure they include best scientific data. Litigious groups and plaintiffs should be discouraged from filing procedural challenges against agencies simply because they do not agree with the agency's decisions, (such as delisting determinations, findings of species listing not warranted). Litigants should be required to pay their own way to curb repeated litigation and foster court cases only on substantive matters. To discourage forum shopping by frequent ESA-litigation-plaintiffs, ESA lawsuits should not be permitted in federal courts other than in a state a species is primarily located. Hourly fees paid by the federal government to litigious attorneys for ESA litigation should be capped like other federal statutes to prevent lucrative payment of attorneys' fees. non-governmental organizations or individuals that file ESA-related lawsuits against the federal government should be barred from receiving federal taxpayer-funded grants. Since money is fungible, litigation should not be subsidized by taxpayers. Section 6(a) should be strengthened to ensure that states' roles in ESA policy provisions have meaning and are enforceable. To encourage voluntary Habitat Conservation Plans should be exempt from critical habitat designations. Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce should authorize certain circumstances to reevaluate, without judicial review, any critical habitat or listing decision where evidence shows significant economic harm . critical habitat economic analyses should be required at the time of any proposed listing . federal agencies should be required to justify why data relied upon for ESA decision is the ""best available"" and why such data is deemed ""accurate"" and ""reliable."" Data used by federal agencies for ESA decisions should be made publicly available .

96,6,"Too much wind turbines is bad idea, they could be doing more harm than good, we need to stop and think since developers are designing higher in the sky . researchers have found that the climate around a large wind farm in Texas was affected by the presence of the turbines. found a ""significant warming trend"" , This could have long term effects on wildlife living in the immediate areas of larger wind farms. It could also affect regional weather patterns as warmer areas affect the formation of cloud and even wind speeds Satellite data over a large area in Texas, that is now covered by four of the world's largest wind farms, found that over a decade the local temperature went up by almost 1C as more turbines are built.. Taking the ground temperatures measured by satellites, they detected a warming of 0.5C at night in the region directly under the farm. This warming effect was local and small - the nighttime warming did not extend beyond the farm's immediate neighborhood. This approach was first attempted by David Keith and colleagues in 2004. When they compared the climate in their model with and without extremely large wind farms (large enough to generate about twice the world's total present electrical demand), they found that in addition to climate effects in the immediate vicinity of the wind farms, there were changes in climate all around the world. Vautard's study agrees with this earlier work, in finding that the climate impacts of wind farms extend beyond the farms themselves and are caused by changes in the flow of the atmosphere that bring warming and cooling to different regions around the wind farms. Wind turbines take energy from the atmosphere and turn it into electricity: so we know they must have some impact on the atmosphere's flow. With industrial grade turbines being built at a terrific rate, scientists have been trying to assess exactly what the effects are both at local and at global levels. Now that the impacts of wind turbines on climate are becoming better understood, more comprehensive studies of complete future energy systems are needed. Research Associate Professor at the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at the University of New York, who led the study, said further research is needed into the affect of the new technology on the wider environment. The spatial pattern of the warming resembles the geographic distribution of wind turbines and the year-to-year land surface temperature over wind farms shows a persistent upward trend from 2003 to 2011, consistent with the increasing number of operational wind turbines with time. possible impacts of wind farms on regional to global scale weather and climate, modelling studies agree that they can significantly affect local scale meteorology.

100,10,"Migratory Birds; FW Service estimates that WIND TURBINES may kill a half a million birds a year. Most migratory birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act which prohibits the taking, killing, possessing, transporting, and importing of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests, except as authorized under by permit. turbines scattered across the continental U.S., is responsible for about 500,000 bird fatalities each year. The primary federally-listed species affected by operation of wind energy facilities in the Midwest Region is the endangered Indiana bat. Other listed plants and animals, in addition to the Indiana bat may be harmed by the construction of the facilities and infrastructure..... A paper published in Science estimates that bats typically save farmers $74 per acre, and that the value of bats to agriculture in the continental United States is roughly $22.9 billion annually. ... analyses suggesting that loss of bats in North America could lead to agricultural losses estimated at more than $3.7 billion/year. Unprecedented numbers of migratory bats are found dead beneath industrial-scale wind turbines during late summer and autumn in both North America and Europe. ....Bald and Golden Eagles Not all bird species are equally vulnerable to wind turbines. Eagles appear to be particularly susceptible. Large numbers of golden eagles have been killed by wind turbines in the western states. However, bald eagles have also been killed, although not in the numbers seen in the West. Wildlife Concerns Associated with Wind Energy Development . Wind energy developments can harm wildlife and their habitat as a result of: collisions with wind turbines and associated infrastructure (e.g., transmission lines and towers); loss and degradation of habitat from turbines and infrastructure at the project site; fragmentation of large habitat blocks into smaller segments that may not support area-sensitive species. wildlife species that we are most concerned about are species that are declining and under threat from other sources. The magnitude and growth of the wind energy industry is great enough that the resulting mortality and habitat lost could have population-level effects on vulnerable wildlife. large-scale fatalities of bats at wind energy facilities. Much of the emphasis of early wind energy-wildlife research was on bird impacts. However, the results of more recent studies indicate that, generally, far more bats than birds are killed, particularly in the Midwest and Eastern United States. Republican lawmakers in 2014 accused the FWS and DOJ of ignoring wildlife violations by wind farm developers while prosecuting fossil fuel companies for similar infractions. Conservation groups have raised similar concerns about environmental enforcement in the wind industry. Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. The committee subpoenaed Ashe on March 11 demanding more than 65 unredacted documents related to communication between federal regulators and wind farm developers and referrals to the Department of Justice for suspected violations of the laws. There are legitimate concerns that the Obama Administration is implementing these laws in an arbitrary fashion,"" Committee Chairman Doc Hastings, a Washington state Republican, said in his opening remarks. ""We're also interested in learning more about what role 'cooperation' between the administration and wind developers plays in making enforcement decisions. FWS says it currently is investigating 17 cases of suspected wildlife violations in the wind industry. Electric company subsidiary killing 14 golden eagles and at least 149 other protected birds at two wind farms in Wyoming. The case ""establishes a precedent for the prosecution of other violations,"" Ashe said. FWS has referred seven cases of suspected violations by wind farms to the DOJ for prosecution",https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FWS-HQ-ES-2015-0165-0166,"the <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">quick</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">fox</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">brown</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">dog</span> <span style=""background-color: #9999ff"">jumped</span> <span style=""background-color: yellow"">lazy</span><i></i>"
